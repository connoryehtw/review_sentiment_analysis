*Staff was not on sight, but the chit-chatting was so obvious.
*Employees lack common sense-customer service.
I was standing there for almost 5 min., until one employee was ready to leave and told staff to take care of me.",1,Negative

A women that works here at night should be fired. Can't even keep track of her orders with an empty driveway. Ridiculous.",1,Negative
"
The lady taking payment was cold. Gave you what you asked for but couldnt aknowledge you as a human being. Also my quesadilla came in the aluminum foil just as always only this time it looks like they cooked it inside the wrapper because its burnt into the foil and its all torn apart. The aluminum and the quesadilla fused together!!!  You can hold it by a thin piece of aluminum and it wont fall! Swing this thing at a baseball and your guaranteed a home run!",1,Negative
"
They are giving out peoples online orders to the wrong people. Placed an order through the app at 11:12pm go to pick it up and say they gave the last online order out… tells me to call the 1800 number. Meanwhile they close at 12 but they are all standing outside at 11:45pm.",1,Negative

Just got hung up on by a manger for asking was they hiring for they location (it was a guy) and I know it wasn’t the female GM because she is always nice, but you guys don’t even realize you hung up on somebody that works for the same company. Definitely will be reporting to HR & Corporate/inspire brand.
He sound like he wasn’t in a good mood, they have a hiring sign out side and the young lady that pick up said they was hiring but I guess your lame assistant manger or lead wasn’t in the best mood. Literally has been the worse experience ever since they open.",1,Negative

Bunch of lazy employees. Waited over 20 minutes for a mobile order.",1,Negative
"
I usually don't make reviews but this time is different. I used be happy with the quality food control this taco bell branch used to have since I've been living on the west side of chicago food here was better employees and employers care a lot more about how food use to be delivered or handled now people only care about a paycheck I am very very disappointed and I really hope they try harder to improve the so very disappointing job they are doing.",1,Negative

HORRIBLE
I KNOW ITS NOT THE BEST FOOD IN THE WORLD BUT THEY LITERALLY TOOK 25 min for my order and items were missing and all the combo drinks!! NEVER coming back!",1,Negative

Place is not open. Doors are always locked",1,Negative

They said their only taking cash I know that’s a lie, I work at restaurants you just don’t want to count your money draw again. Then I said what time you close he said now, it’s 11:15 at that moment.I  Look on the website it says 12 Am. Get it together. It’s too many people that need jobs for workers to be like this.",1,Negative

Asked for steak. TWICE. Got nothing but beans and lettuce. I think they are laundering the beef here. Its bad. Just avoid. Also who designed the entrance? Its multiple car accidents waiting to happen.",1,Negative

Worst taco bell experience ever! The drive-thru guy taking my order was RUDE! I went on the afternoon of June 19th.

Also, the food was TERRIBLE! The chulupas tasted like they had been sitting out for hours and they made me feel sick!

I would avoid this location until they get their operations in order.",1,Negative

Worst Taco Bell. Poor and slow service.",1,Negative

If I could give 0 stars that would have been what I chose. I came in during my 30 min. lunch break. I pulled up to the window and they were fast to ask me what I wanted so I asked for a moment. not even 10 seconds later they asked me again to order so I felt rushed. I orders a flamin hot taco duo. I was informed they no longer have the flamin hot taco, only Doritos. I said okay give me the Doritos duo, then I was informed they no longer offer the duo, I respond okay then you guys should take down this sign. They informed me they were waiting for a new sign. I order 3 small things proceed to the window to pay. I pay get my food drive off and go home. when I get home I open my nachos ate one and the beans on the nachos is hard, like sitting out in the sun for 3 days dried hard, they visibly looked crunchy and unless the person prepared my food with their eyes closed they seen this and decided to serve it to the customers anyways. I open my tostada and same issue mountain of crunchy hard old beans. so I can't eat that either. I was going to just let the issue with the nachos go but after opening up my second item my lunch was pretty much a waste of my time and money. So i try to call in, I get a message cant get thru but we would love to hear from you try your call again later. I've never written a review about any place before but when I couldn't get thru to someone it left me with no choice. If your employees clearly don't care about the customers they serve (the reason anyone in the establishment has a job) then why are you employing them. I work customer service and if this was the level of service I provided I would surely be fired. Very unhappy customer.",1,Negative
"
Buyer Beware!
I ordered 2 meals: the nacho bellgrande and a taco. The tacos were excellent but the nachos were horrible. The chips were fried in bad oil. I returned the nachos and they gave me 6 tacos (all of which were missing at least one ingredient). I'm never going back.",1,Negative
"
If I could give them no stars I would. I visit this Taco Bell all the time. I came in last week with my son & the cashier told us they were hiring & really needed the help. He told us to fill out the app online & then come back the next day to have them pull the app & that’s what we did. Today was his interview. The girl that interviewed him asked him why he didn’t apply to the Taco Bell around our house? I definitely don’t understand that relevance. She ended the he interview by telling him that she’s not going to offer him the position because, “they close pretty late & she didn’t want to be responsible of getting him home.”  She didn’t think he had reliable transportation. I’ve never got denied a position due to the manager not wanting to be responsible for getting me home. I didn’t know that was a concern or responsibility of the coworkers or managers but he did have reliable transportation. He felt discriminated against. I called the store to get an email or phone number to express our concerns with someone. Of course the young lady that she interviewed him answered & asked why did I need that info. I told her that my son felt he was discriminated against. She immediately got very aggressive & started yelling in my ear, “ first of all, first of all”. I interrupted & tried to diffuse her aggression with no avail so I hung up. I just wasn’t going to argue with an unprofessional, ignorant Taco Bell employee. I consider myself more professional than that. I called the corporate office & lodged a complaint & was told the district manager would call me back in 3 days. About 30 mins later, I got a call from the same young lady pretending to be someone else. She explained that they gave my son another store address that was hiring as a common courtesy which wasn’t true & she stated they couldn’t give out the managers info that I asked for. I explained that the young lady could’ve given me the email to corporate that’s on the window of the store to express any concerns or issues as the sign in the window clearly states. Instead she instantly got aggressive & offended like we were accusing her of discrimination. Her actions only proved that she was guilty of discriminating against my son. The lady then said well she couldn’t give me the manager’s info & I explained again she never attempted to explain anything or offer anything that she could do. I told her I had already called corporate & lodged a complaint. At that time I ended the call with well thank u for taking the time to interview my son & you have a great day. These employees are very unprofessional & I feel blessed that my son wasn’t offered that position. If she conducts interviews  & speak to customer’s inquiring for info like that I can imagine how she speak to their employees. I’ll never eat at Taco Bell anywhere period due to this experience. Whatever happened to professionally telling an candidate we have other candidates to interview & we’ll get back to you when we make our decision & just don’t call them. That hiring supervisor definitely need some more training because she’s going to get them an lawsuit.",1,Negative
"
Very Poor Customer Service! Not the first time in here and I always see attitude given from workers to customer and workers are always demanding to order on ur own. In my case I refuse to use self ordering and on top workers were ghetto too much laughing n talking. No manners at all. I wasn't even handed a receipt because Raneisha was too busy talking to others! So I grabbed my own receipt. Anyways these girls need better training!",1,Negative

I usually don’t take the time to write reviews, but this is literally the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to in my entire life. I’d just avoid this location all together if I were you",1,Negative
"
I ordered 4 supreme tacos. The bag was sealed with a sticker that said sealed for you when I got home I opened the bag and all my taco were at the bottom of the bag all the paper was ripped and the taco juice was sogging through the bag they weren’t even wrapped right.",1,Negative
"
Customer service here sucks they dont deserve not even one star, we went in they had us order of the machine, then we waited 20min so they can tell us that they never got our order. So much for new technology. If the manager would check her front dining room or maybe have more help this wouldnt happen.",1,Negative
"
Sometimes good, some other ones not. When you do tacos you must pay attention to the amount of each ingredients for that taco. Same amount always. Sometimes they give a taco with almost no meat or cheese for example. Not good at all.",1,Negative
"
Had a very unpleasant interaction with what seemed like a manager or an older employee! I pulled up to the drive through window and this man aggressively started telling me that I had to stop at the order speaker. Something that I didn’t know since it was my first time placing an online order. I apologized  and told him I was sorry I didn’t know but he continued with his bad attitude and insisting that I had to stop at the speaker first! I said ok I know, I know, and this man said “No, you obviously don’t know” LACK of professionalism!",1,Negative
"
I made a drive thru order (chicken quesadilla) and they are not checking the items in the bag I was missing the hard shell taco but the drive thru worker said there's two items in your bag. They need to check orders before they give it to the customers.",1,Negative
"
The order took a long time to receive. It was a simple order but still wrong. When going back to correct it they questioned it. The receipt was correct just not what they gave me. No compensation for the wasted time or even an apology. Definitely not returning.",1,Negative

Food order was wrong even after returning it the first time to be corrected. Tacos were fairly cold and we were only giving 6 sauce packets when we had over 15 tacos.",1,Negative

This tacobell drive thru is extremely slow. I waited almost 45 minutes for my food. Customer service is horrible. I don't expect 5 star dining from taco Bell but I've never experienced what I've experienced today. Never coming back here again.",1,Negative
"
Went to buy taco and was told they were closed at 8pm but its cars in the parking lot lights on,  not 1 sign or anything that states they close early than normal while their was employees sitting in the car in the parking lot looks bad for this business. Second time I've had terrible service here and sick of it they need new workers at night.",1,Negative
"
Went around 6pm at night. My receipt had the right order but received the wrong food. When I walked in to go get it fixed, the Lady tried to say I ordered wrong even tho the receipt had the right order, and gave me attitude about it, and was downright rude about correcting my order they messed up. I was not rude or arrogant, I simply said that I received the wrong order.",1,Negative

I am Mexican and never had or will have tacobell because it trash and you should marry Mexican for good tacos 🌮",1,Negative

The tacos were stuck to the paper,cold I was charged .50. Extra  for sour cream which is suppose to come with the supreme tacos.it was a mess .went there a couple of nights ago had they had no tomatoes.",1,Negative
"
Horrible service. Went to the drive thru and we were looking at the menu and the lady says “ are you ready to order” with a bad attitude and we were like actually yes and then she said “ well come on let’s go”. No way to ever talk to a customer we didnt say anything nasty for her to speak like that. I was so angry I told my boyfriend to drive away. Never again.",1,Negative

They always mess up on my order & the food doesn’t taste right. I rather drive to the one on Ogden they do a better job there and the time of the wait is pretty much the same distance.",1,Negative

I’ve visited this location twice within the last week BOTH times the person working the drive thru menu informed me they were out of shredded chicken, nacho chips, steak, and many other items before I could even begin to order. With the amount of food items she mentioned they were out of it didn’t seem like they had anything to serve. Needless to say I drove away. Skip this location because they aren’t efficient!",1,Negative

Bad service!!! Taco bell should require drug testing!! Casier Miata seemed a little off HIGH on the job just fooling around so UNPROFESIONAL. Never again if i could give ZERO stars i would.",1,Negative

The worst service ever. They wouldn't serve this guy because his tow truck wouldn't fit thru the drive, he ask me would i buy it for him they got on the intercom and made the statement that i couldn't purchase his food for him.

For some reason the app won’t let me order dine-in or takeout with the app, I had to place an order for drive thru and give my name at the counter.
Lots of fountain pop was out. Otherwise, Taco Bell.

Update: I probably stayed too long on a hot morning and the manager decided I was homeless and came out to harass me with a malevolent grin. No wonder nobody dines in here the three times I went inside.",2,Negative

You can count the shreds of cheese on your overpriced taco. The Mexican pizza tastes like a Duracell battery. They were out of the size drinks that come with your combo so you had to take a down size for the same price",2,Negative

They didn't take my order although i had been standing there quite a while but a guy of another ethnicity came in behind me and they hurried up and took his order. And they took a long time getting my order ready.",2,Negative

Picture of what I ordered online but instead got two crunchy and one soft taco for one box. Then one Doritos locos taco with a soft taco along with nachos. Missing the most important part of the orders: two chalupas and a 5 layer burrito.

I'm glad I got some kind of food but it really is not hard to get what's right on the receipt.",2,Negative

What's funny but not funny..I read reviews beforehand. There were way too many wrong order received entries. I took my chances anyway. I ordered black bean  loaded fries but got refried beans. Instead of loaded chicken flatbread, I received steak. Lucky for me I like refried beans and steak. I also used a gift card so I feel like I used ""free"" money so it didnt upset me.  However, I did get a little chuckle because I was fairly warned.",3,Negative
"
Half the time I order they forget my drink I don't usually leave reviews but if your reading this make sure u remind them about the drink if your doing delivery, they are good about refunds but it sucks eating a meal with nothing to wash it down but tap water if it just happened once ok but it happens way too much",3,Negative
"
These self service kiosks are annoying. I understand their use when the lines are long but seeing as how nobody else was in the store when I walked in and nobody came to the counter to take my order, I was basically forced to use the kiosk. Seems like they are fading away with the whole interaction between the merchants and customers. We all don't purchase food with plastic, cash is still used. Gah!",3,Negative

I ate here the other day!! Inside is very slow because the location is awkwardly placed in the neighborhood for walkin customers!

However they took a while to serve me and the cashier apologized and gave me a drink cup on the HOUSE ! She was so kind and young a nice heavier set young black lady.
The manager was sitting in the empty dinning room, doing paperwork! The food was amazing tho!!
The manager was an older heavy set black woman with a comeover, she was complaining to the sweet cashier who helped me with great service about the boys at work drinking and smoking on the job. It was lunch and A show!!! Literally such an amazing experience! The young woman,  was respectful and chuckled and kept on cleaning. The old manager seemed crabby and unhappy but the food was very good! And that cashier deserves a raise! This was at 3pm Saturday!

I love how she handed me a free cup for the wait! You don't see such professionalism and courtesies from corporate, low level workers!

Also hearing the gossip about the store was amazing as well! Better than Netflix!!! I will definitely be visiting again. 😊

I have Doordashed food from her, twice since then ! And I may visit again in person soon ! I hope that young cashier will become a manager some day!",4,Positive
"
I try not to be too hard customer service workers because there's other people that do that on a daily basis and they don't need another one doing it I personally work in the customer service industry and it is not more so some way to just make ends meet in the meantime for most people in the fortunately the only option for others which has been the case in Boston areas when I did work there they got my order right and were not rude It's the only one in the area and pretty newly built so you would recommend",4,Neutral
"
Craving Taco Bell after completing a run at the Des Plaines River Trail, I visited this location because it sat en route on my drive. Due to Covid-19 precautions, the drive-thru was the only option for ordering versus going inside the restaurant to order. I ended up ordering the grilled cheese burrito box w/ a mountain dew drink which was solely because the grilled cheese burrito sounded tasty. If not for it being promoted on their sign I probably would have ordered something I had before already.

I received my food in a reasonable timeframe which was handed to me in a container to prevent any human contact whatsoever. Though I doubt I will ever dine-in, this location obviously has not come up with any alternative plans on allowing customers to dine-in.

While eating my grilled cheese burrito box in the parking lot, there were two customers that had issues with their orders as I ate my food. With the drive-thru being solely used, both customers were outside of the door knocking and even having to walk towards the drive-thru to get the employee's attention. Like any other fast food restaurant, this place is no exception on the lines of being a hit-or-miss as far as possibly receiving mediocre service or food.

I personally had a pleasant experience at this location and will most likely return while in the area if I have that craving for Taco Bell. I really enjoyed the grilled cheese burrito box, the grilled cheese burrito is something I could definitely see myself craving from time to time. Yes, it was good! And lastly, I do like this location because it does not have sketchy individuals lurking in the parking lot.

I went here to grab some lunch. I don't eat meat, so I switch everything to black beans. When I got my order, I noticed several things were still meat.This staff was so nice and fixed my wrong order without any pushback or unprofessionalism.",4,Positive
"
Stayed in the drive thru way too long waiting for my food. Waiting over 5 mins to place my order at the intercom board and spent over 8 mins waiting for my food at the window. I had the mind, heart and taste buds set for a nacho box. So I stayed and waited for my order.  Was it worth it, maybe. I was hungry so .... I'm not sure if I'd return in the future. But if I do, I'll definitely pack a little bit more patience.",4,Neutral

The sign at the door says it's open till 8 PM.
I went to this place yo get a happy meal for child. It was 7:50 and the door was closed and worker inside were moping the floor, and waving to me closed.
I pointed the time and they totaly ignored me.
Never go back to that store. Bad service and public relation",1,Negative

They SHOULD BE CLOSED…We don’t have employees, so I can’t take your order” that was the answer from the store manager. I understand is short on staff but even if we were willing to wait they are not willing to help. One of the worst McDonald’s around. Even without people they are so slow give you the order always wrong and the manager doesn’t even know what’s going on. Poor customer service! Save sometime go somewhere else!",1,Negative

This McDonald’s is the worst!! My coworker and I have stopped here twice. The first time it was a bunch of high school kids that didn’t know what they were doing and had no customer service at all! This morning we went to grab breakfast thinking it was a just a bad day last time. We ordered food and asked for our drinks for them to tell us they don’t serve soft drinks this early! Are you kidding me?? I’ve never had a restaurant tell me they don’t serve soft drinks. Never coming back here!",1,Negative

Terrible. No drive-thru. No one working the register. One kiosk with a line. Only go here if you want to wait 20 min. for a coffee.",1,Negative

This is the weirdest McDonald’s I’ve ever been to. I appreciate the simplicity, but it was NOT busy and took at least 10 minutes to get one mcchicken biscuit. Very frustrating. Also couldn’t find anyone when I went in. Ordered at kiosk but just an odd setup for McDonald’s.",2,Negative

Well, it's McDonald's, what else is there to say? Inside and outside, this McDonald's is much more presentable than almost any other. Granting that this is Glenview, a very bourgie area (especially the north side of town), so visually you have the lovely Plaza del Prado storefront on the exterior, while the interior is very spacious and clean, it is so nice aesthetically that you almost forget that it's McDonald's. Even the play area is nice! [As I am a kid no longer, nor do I have any kids and I fully intend to keep it that way, this is not an issue for me. I'd be perfectly okay with no play area at all, but if one is to be included, make it like this location, an open play room without the disgusting plastic tubing and ball pit that come with the stench of stale urine and harbor all manner of nasty critters.] McDonald's adapts its facilities very well to location, but no matter where you go they have the same garbage food. Actually, the food might be a little worse at this location. I remember when I found a fly in an order of fries back in 2001. It did not simply fall in, the fly was deep fried... French flies! Needless to say, that experience forever ruined McDonald's fries for me, I have not consumed a single McDonald's fry since! Though that's not a major loss because McDonald's fries suck anyways (scrawny shoestring cut, usually mushy), so not much of a sacrifice. This place is in no danger because of its aesthetics, and because even the bourgeoisie will go for bottom-of-the-barrel food now and then.",2,Negative

Play area for kids is gone.  Now there is a TV room for kids with three tables that light up in different spots when touched.  My kids played with those for 5 minutes and then stared at the TV while they ate.  I wasn't able to turn off the TV on my own and other people came in to watch before I could ask staff if they would turn it off.  I liked it when they had air hockey instead and probably won't be back again.",3,Negative

It's ok if you're in a hurry and don't want to make food but I wouldn't recommend it. The burgers you get definitely does not look like the picture but has the same things in it. Normally has a place to sit and eat inside.",3,Negative

We come here about 1-2 times per month with our kids. Free wifi and clean.

He’s a real awesome manager.",5,Positive

This restaurant has recently been updated and it is beautiful inside. I like the new trend towards some movable furniture in their restaurants, so that different group sizes and types of people can be accommodated. There is also a partially enclosed ""children's room"" with special light tables and activities. McDs is also the best place to stop for a quick meeting with a friend or colleague because of their $1 fountain drinks! It looks small from the outside (a storefront in a strip mall), but is quite large inside. Plenty of parking and friendly service.",5,Positive

Update: after 2 weeks I still have not received a refund from the owner, even though the reply said they would. Again just reinforcing the poor service at this place.

We’re visiting St. Louis and saw the reviews for this coffee shop and decided to check it out. Worst decision I could have made. The coffee shop itself has a nice atmosphere and there is a variety of things to choose from. But there was about 3 people ahead of us when we ordered our two iced lattes and it literally took 45min to get our mediocre coffee. I’m not sure if I went on a bad day bc the coffee shop was not that busy (but that was their excuse). Even the ordering process was tedious. If you have 45min to an hour to waste then you could try this place but other than that I would recommend looking elsewhere.",1,Negative
"
Edit: just editing to let the owner know that this was on Wednesday September 14th around 4:40ish.

First off, I was shocked by the price. I really didn’t expect a small latte to be over $6. When I saw my receipt, I saw I was charged for a medium and not a small. I’m pretty soft-spoken but I corrected the barista when she repeated the order, and made sure to say it was supposed to be a small. At first I enjoyed the latte, even though I didn’t think it was worth the price. However the more I drank it, the more pronounced the bitter aftertaste became. I’m not claiming to be a coffee expert, but the ashy taste the coffee left wasn’t pleasant, to the point where I didn’t want to finish it. I tried calling but nobody answered the phone.",1,Negative
"
Slowest service I ever had!!! Waited in the extremely hot patio for longer than 30 mins for just one cup of coffee! They won’t let you wait inside the store and only allow you to wait in the patio which is steaming hot! Coffee extremely mediocre! It being a local store does NOT excuse it from blatantly disrespecting customers’ experience! “Northwest coffee roasting?” Plz just rename it as customer roasting under the heat and long wait!",1,Negative
"
First time visit.  Poor customer service.  We were pushed out the door by the owner to wait for our order.  Not welcoming at all.  Almost $100 for a few drinks and 2 lbs of coffee beans.  Not impressed at all.",1,Negative
"
I'd leave less than a star, if I could. I waited 35 minutes for a coffee that never came. I tried to cancel the coffee, but was told that since it was ""free"" (I used points I'd earned from being a repeat customer here), I couldn't do so. They were making coffee at the rate of 3 drinks every 10 minutes. I counted because I sat around with nothing to do for a good long while. At 20 minutes in, I was told I was the 6th drink in line. 15 minutes later, I was told I was the 3rd in line.

I'm shocked at the lack of professionalism and the fact that no one thought to warn me it would take this long. Severely disappointed at this place. A cup of coffee can get delayed a bit. I'm a patient person. But however busy a coffee shop is, a 35 minute wait without any warning is unacceptable. And that no one seemed remotely apologetic is astounding.

Needless to say, I won't be returning. I'd suggest you don't too, if there's more than a couple of customers for them to serve. They clearly cannot handle a crowd.",1,Negative

Waited 25 min for one medium caramel macchiato & left a tip. When I asked where my drink was after 20 min I got a slight attitude in my response. Not cool",1,Negative

I would often frequent this place given them being a small black owned business and have a good cup of joe.

But I had an experience recently that made me re-think ever returning. The staff yelled at an individual experiencing homelessness who was asking folks for money, “No No No, Leave my customers alone. Get out of here” (something of this sort). I understand that being a business there is a fine line here - but there were many other ways that this could have been handled, from pulling this individual aside and having a conversation to offering them coffee or a pastry (as many other shops do, like rise coffee in the grove). Yet, I found the yelling to be undignifying and it led to a harsh interaction between staff and this individual. As a business that sits close to mental health agencies like independence center, there are an array of opportunities for them to understand unhoused or mentally ill folx rather than be so overtly unwelcoming. When we don’t understand, we can seek to understand. Or when we worry that these populations could affect business, you can still seek to acknowledge the human being rather than yell at them.

During this same time at this shop, I realized that their pastries came from Costco as the employee was putting out pastries from a Kirkland box. It’s one thing to utilize pastries from another business, but the up charge on these is really high and I just don’t think this is acceptable. Perhaps, this was a one off and they ran out that day, but I’ve noticed the same pastries regularly.

I thought for a month or so before posting this review because I don’t want to discount a local business, but I just want folx to know that there are other coffee businesses who also have unhoused folks come in and they are given food and coffee and treated with dignity and there are places who homemake their pastries & are not price gouging from Kirkland.

I am open to returning If this business seeks to reframe the way in which they treat unhoused folks. I just cannot ethically return until a change occurs. Humans are humans.",1,Negative

Disappointed!!! Staff was not friendly and didn't know what they were doing. They told my sister and I that we couldn't look at the roasting machine!! 3 of us came together and coffee was either bitter or bland, none of us liked our drinks! Furthermore my (tiny) large size was about $9 which I wouldn't have minded paying for quality coffee and friendly service, but a total waste spent here.  The setting has potential but unless they retrain current staff or hire new staff this place won't last long.",1,Negative

My family and I were just there Sunday (March 7th) and immediately left to go elsewhere. Hardly any one was wearing their masks, not even some employees, nor was there enforcement for people to keep masks on, although there wasa big sign clearly stating to keep them on. The employees also did not look in a hurry to help customers by taking their orders and keep the line moving. Very unfortunate because we were sincerely looking forward to trying out their coffee. We noticed we weren't alone in leaving immediately upon arrival neither when an elderly man pulled up shortly after our arrival, walked into the courtyard to see the long line inside, hardly any one wearing masks as well, then turned around and walked back to his car to leave to go elsewhere.

I never write reviews to complain but we're hoping the next time we visit St. Louis that things will have improved by then and we'll finally get to try some Northwest Coffee. As a coffee roaster hobbyist I, again, was looking very forward to the experience at Northwest because of their great reputation and quality I've heard much about.",1,Negative

If you actually know cofffee DO NOT come here. We had to pull teeth to find out what coffees they could brew with pour over. After waiting 20 mins we were served the coffee in to-go cups.

We have been customers since 2014 of Northwest Coffee. After recent experience I don’t feel it is what it used to be (was more about transparency rather than the cost of the drink).

I've been touring coffee shops in the area trying to pick a favorite. This one is not a contender. I have very little demands from service in a coffee shop. Just be reasonably friendly. This shop couldn't even meet that bar. It was very empty and I felt awkward as I sat and sipped my subpar Americano from a to-go cup, as they never asked if I wanted to stay. I can't think of a reason to go back or recommend it. It wasn't horrible, but with so many other coffee options in the area I would go somewhere else.",2,Negative

Best black coffee pour over in St Louis. If you like coffee, this is a must.

EDIT: I've revised down to a 2 star review because of awful service. I was not necessarily in a rush, but the coffee was to go as I had things to do, and decided to get a cold brew (which are just kinds fine, not as good as a pour over) to speed things up, while my companion got a coffee and steamed milk. My cold brew took around 45 minutes, at which point we reminded the batista about the other drink. It was another 15 minutes, and upon being reminded again, he finally made her drink. I don't entirely blame the barista: on a Sunday afternoon you should have more than one person working in the whole coffee shop. Normally waiting a little longer wouldn't be a problem but I can't justify going here again knowing there's a chance my drink will take nearly an hour when I could drive a little further to Blueprint or Kaldi's or La Cosecha and get a similar level of quality with a guaranteed level of service that far exceeds Northwest.

Very disappointing, and will not be back anytime soon. If timeliness is important, I don't recommend you patronize this establishment either.",2,Negative

For being a black owned coffee shop they sure have a bunch of young rude white girls. Everytime I go in there i feeel ignored and they rush me but I see white customers getting the best treatment.

The environment and coffee/smoothie was great!  The only reason for the 3/5 stars is the way the Manager/supervisor spoke to the employees.  Not at all like a leader.  Female, 20's, thin, strawberry blonde curly hair.  She was counting the drawer when we walked in and made a face to the other 2 for someone else to help us, but to wait til she was done counting.  That's fine, I run a business too and we get it.  She finished counting the drawer and made a comment ""is no one gonna take their order?""  1. She was right there, why couldn't she? 2. Don't belittle your staff. 3. Did she tell them she was done?  She was so off-putting I didn't even order anything. The gentlemen making our drinks and the woman behind him had great attitudes!

There is plenty of seating, which is great, but the counter space is literally closed off and pretty tight. (I walked into a bunch of smoke today from the one other customer).

Quality of service: 3 stars
Would I recommend: yes if you are not in a rush and don’t mind paying for any mistakes on their end

I have been living close by for a few months now and have been a customer maybe 8-9 times. I come back because it’s location is very convenient for me, I like supporting local businesses, the staff is friendly and try to provide good service, and because I like what I order and end up getting.

However, there have been a few times I did not receive what I ordered, and most recently I called to place an order and was left on hold for 15 minutes before giving up and going in-person, where I saw the phone was still left off the ringer. During these times I’ve never been offered a solution or compensation (coffee on the house etc) which other coffee shops and restaurants usually offer out of courtesy and to maintain customer satisfaction. I was also recently notified about their online ordering system, which in my opinion has UI issues currently and is not easy to use due to its bugs. Thus, I would stay customer service, professionalism, and their technological tools need to develop a bit more to compare to competitive businesses.",3,Neutral

Paid $25 for a pour over, lox bagel, and a con panna. The sandwich was really for lack of a better term, weird. The lox were of fine quality but the bagel wasn’t even warmed or toasted, light on the cream cheese, weird drippy honey mustard, a leaf of lettuce and some tomato. The menu said capers but I couldn’t taste any present which is a bummer since that’s my favorite part of the whole spread. It’d be upgraded with some red onion, a toast, and maybe a house whipped cream cheese. I really crave bagels and St. Louis just had no options, I’ll keep looking. The con panna was bitter, I expected a bit of sweetness from the whipped cream but it had nothing added so the whole thing was just kind of underwhelming. Pour over was decent, service was fine, music was a bit loud. I’d come back on another sunny day for the patio with my dog to hang with a friend but I’d probably skip the food and opt for a drip coffee or tea.",3,Neutral

Nice indoor outdoor space in the patio. Thanks for the ample power and Wi-Fi, delicious spinach smoothie.

I'm sure their coffee is great - this review only pertains too their chai latte. It was spicy to the point of un-drinkable and I ended up asking them to dump it out. Perhaps the menu could mention it. The first sip was arresting, a bitter I hadn't ever tasted. The barista noticed us adding lots of sugar and brought over vanilla syrup which was super nice, but it made is both overly sweet and still incredibly bitter/spicy. I wish they had offered an alternative when I brought it up nearly full to be dumped out, and would recommend they offer it to other customers as I won't be back for fear there isn't anything I'd like.

Four stars, with the hopeful anticipation the coffee will be spectacular the next time. To explain:
I tried the Northwest House Blend for espresso...the beginning of the cup was quite mediocre, but the second half had a wonderful complexity, with all four coffee varieties making themselves present and a delightful balance between the acidity and sweetness.  A whole cup of this would have been exquisite and memorable. (I am certain this is easily achievable, with some dialing in of the espresso). I bought half a pound of this blend in coffee beans for home (btw, very reasonably priced)
The staff was very polite and helpful and the location is very bicycle friendly.  I hope to visit again!",4,Positive

Neat little coffee shop. Small menu of food items but a broad caffeinated selection. Decent coffee. You can order item on the menu a la carte and they'll put it together for you.

I am a fan of this place. This place is a great local brewing/roasting company that makes great coffee.  They have small finger foods and a limited ""lunch"" type menu.  This is a great place to go and get work done, study, or just to chill with your friends.  It has both indoor and outdoor seating.  My only issue with this place is that it has weird hours.  I would want it open longer, but alas that is up to the company.  Nonetheless, if you want a good cup of coffee with some small foods, with a local flavor, then this is place for you...just make sure it coincides with their hours.

I'm no coffee expert and I only drink coffee occasionally, but when I want a latte, this is where I come. The coffee's good and the prices reasonable.

The employees are nice and the owner is often around and seems like a great guy. Very approachable and invested, both in his business and in his community.

The egg sandwiches are unique in that they scramble the eggs with a milk frother, which makes for a light, fluffy egg that isn’t all oily or dripping in butter.  I’ve never seen that anywhere else and it yields a delicious sandwich.",4,Positive

Incredible coffee. Dirty building. We were very impressed with the mocha frio which is like a frappe. The coffee is genuine.

They could definitely invest in cleaning, painting, AC, more pleasing esthetics, new tables, and new chairs.",4,Positive

Friendly folks dishing out good coffee in an unpretentious environment.

In my search for quality coffee shops, I stumbled upon this place. It's got a cool vibe: unfinished and apparently not pretentious. Even less finished than Alaskan Klondike.

It's got the bones of what I love in a coffee shop: beans roasted in house, no automated espresso machines, a focus on quality coffee. (Great foam on this cappuccino!)

But it falls short in the beans' roast and had too many blends as opposed to region specific coffees, African, Cental America, Asian. Don't get me wrong, they serve it, but it's not the focus. They should at least always have one region brewing. And they need to serve a much lighter roast, I feel the roast competed with the beans' natural flavors, rather than augmented.

Overall, great experience, but not the best. That crown's still reserved for Alaskan Klondike.",4,Positive

A few weeks ago it was a very warm, sunny Tuesday morning and I wanted to grab some coffee and breakfast before driving back home to Chicago. I'd spent a weekend in STL with my friends and simply searched for highly-rated coffee shops nearby when I saw the photos for Northwest Coffee. I knew this was the place I needed to stop before my long drive.

I was actually shocked to see how many people were here on a weekday at 10 am, but that obviously means that this place was the right choice. I ordered a bagel with lox, an iced coffee with almond milk, and picked up a bag of Ethiopian coffee. I had to wait a liiiiittle longer than expected (~15-20 minutes) for the food and bag of coffee to be ground, but honestly that didn't bother me at all because the ambience, iced coffee, and sunshine on the patio tempted me to stay longer than I'd originally planned to.

A man was walking around and greeting people (including me!), stopping at tables, and just providing overall warmth to the atmosphere. The Strokes' latest album played over the speakers while a woman roasted coffee in a very cool, giant machine in the middle of the shop.

It was fortuitous that I found this place, and I now have the fantastic souvenir of enjoying many cups of coffee to come, from hundreds of miles away.",5,Positive

This is from their new location within @Schnucks on 8650 Big Bend BLVD. got the pour over Mocha Java. Great service and I could taste the chocolate notes.",5,Positive
"
The outside patio area is really nice. Plenty of room, lots of seating.  There is also indoor seating, but who wouldn't want to sit outside on a nice day? Great place to go relax, meet a friend, or sit and enjoy the weather over your favorite brew.",5,Positive
"
Best bagel, coffee, service, and atmosphere. Bagel + coffee cost me $5-something, so reasonable prices here, too. I will be back.",5,Positive
"
This place has good service! I didn't try the coffee, but I got a Mango Tango (smoothie). It was delish. The owner refurbished an old car garage, and made a coffee shop out of it. It's very unique. You can go to hang out with friends or you can sit alone on your phone.",5,Positive
"
A beautiful coffee garden that I found to be a bit ducked off in CWE neighbored with Scarlet Wine. Dog friendly. Child friendly. Ample outdoor seating. Jeremiah offered friendly service and a delicious Bianca Latte. I tried the egg wrap with salsa - simply egg and cheese in a tortilla. Easily eaten in hand. I also shared a liege waffle with #6 that I added blueberries and strawberries.  It was a bit chewy but a waffle when you're hungry is always gonna be good. These were small meals that exist perfectly with a coffee when it's early and you have things to do with your day. My total was around 27$ including a 10% tip. I'll be back. Gotta try a smoothie next go.",5,Positive
"
Northwest is a St. Louis staple. I used to live down the street and every time I go back to St. Louis I make sure I stop in. The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable about different espresso drinks. You can study, work, and catch up with a friend here and it's a perfect date spot.",5,Positive
"
Love this place for a quick meeting or a quiet place to work.
The coffee is amazing!",5,Positive
"
This place is welcoming to animals. Be sure to have them contained; on leash, in travel backpack for small pets, etc! As for a cream cup if your pet has been extra good. Worth every penny. In addition, there is a rotation of items, so visit often!",5,Positive
"
Their coffee is amazzzzzing. Been going here and performing here for years. Great spot for introverts, extroverts and ambiverts. New outside space is social distance friendly and great for bonfires and get togethers.",5,Positive
"
The ambience is good. My first experience was not the best. But recently I have liked their espresso drinks. Also a good place to work. Can get busy at times. I'll recommend their coffee over food.

An update: I seem to love their drinks the more I come here, specially the mocha. Make sure to sign up for the rewards to get free drinks from time to time.",5,Positive
"
A perfect place to work if you are looking for somewhere other than your room to work at. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Good coffee and some nice desert.",5,Positive
"
Everyone working here has been so kind, they even helped me find my ice scraper a couple months ago when I dropped it out front. Cold brew is strong and delicious with hints of cherry and dark chocolate.",5,Positive
"
At the start of COVID, I needed to find a local-ish whole-bean coffee for my suddenly at-home coffee ""trips."" After trying a few different kinds, I ordered a sample of the Roaster's Choice from Northwest. That was almost two years ago, and I haven't ordered any other coffee since. We buy 5lbs at a time, confident it's the best every-day cup of coffee I could possibly imagine. Wanted to leave this review before I re-up yet again.",5,Positive
"
Good spot to get some work done or meet up with friends. There is an indoor seating area as well as a large outdoor area with plenty of seating. My only gripe is that the food is way overpriced, so I suggest just drinking coffee and going somewhere else for food.",5,Positive
"
I went to the new Schnucks Webster Groves location and loved it! Convenient location.

The owner is really friendly, there’s a great variety and selection to chose from. I really liked my Vanilla Latte 👍🏻 Will be a returning customer!",5,Positive
"
My new favorite spot! Some of the best coffee I’ve had. They have a great music playlist too.",5,Positive
"
My guy introduced me to this place a year ago and I’ve been coming back at least once a week since then for what I think is one of the best chicken salad sandwiches I’ve had.  They also have an amazing cold drink called the Frio.  Simple way to put my experience here is it’s a lovely spot with amazing coffee, delicious food, a nice patio with fans and shade along with a friendly community vibe. Definitely recommend anyone to check it out.",5,Positive
"
Took my friend for a belated birthday outing! Very nice place. Want to go back to sit outdoors and sip on something cool! The staff was excellent!",5,Positive

"
A friend and I enjoyed some dirty chai latte and wonderful conversation.",5,Positive
"
We visited here from out of town. Good coffee. Great space, awesome vibes. Extremely Covid friendly. And the owner stopped by and chatted with us for a bit. Perfect for our one year old to walk around and be a baby. Loved our visit. Highly recommend this place!",5,Positive
"
Former barista here, and this is one of the best coffees I’ve had in STL! NW’s oat latte and red eye were excellent, a reminder why it’s great to get your coffee from a place that also roasts its beans. The taste of the beans were fresh, balanced and super flavorful. Baristas were also super attentive, were wearing masks and they had us wait outside after we ordered to maintain social distance. Hope they can open more locations in the future!",5,Positive
"
By far my favorite coffee shop in STL. The staff is amazing, the coffee is unbeatable, and the vibe is so chill - perfect for studying or catching up with people. The owner is so kind and makes sure everyone has the best experience possible. Can't recommend it enough.",5,Positive
"
I visit NW Coffee nearly everyday because I think it offers the best Coffee in St Louis. I especially like enjoy the casual atmosphere where everyone feels welcome.",5,Positive
"
I love coming here to study and get coffee/food. The owner is very nice and wants to make sure everyone is enjoying their time. They have outlets near the picnic tables so you can charge your devices which is very thoughtful. My go to drink is a double shot on ice!",5,Positive
"
I'd live here if I could. Great place to meet and hang out with a great cuppa what's your pleasure",5,Positive

Great coffee and staff. Dog friendly,  though the free dog treat box looks sketchy. Beans a bit pricey. Open outside area. Wilson is doing great for his community. Need a car-mocha(caramel mocha) now.",5,Positive

"
One of the best coffee shops in St. Louis, plus they are open past 2pm. Great place for business meetings, studying or hanging our with friends.",5,Positive
"
Wonderful coffee spot. Try the bagel and lox!",5,Positive
"
This is the best coffee we have had anywhere. They roast their own and they know what they are doing. The espresso is the finest around. The store is cool, the staff is friendly and you need to go. They also have some of the healthiest eggs around as they steam them. No butter, no oil, just eggs!!",5,Positive
"
The place is pretty big, lot of space inside and outside. Outside is perfect for family, just a little space for kids to run around.

Inside is pretty dim, rustic, just low-key.

What makes this place is the fact that it's tucked away, not a lot of traffic on the residential.

Thanks to the chill barista, she let me have a coffee despite being a few cents short, I'll come back and pay it forward 👍🏾

On return, I wouldn't mind trying other things on the menu.",5,Positive
"
Great place with plenty of options on their menu. I love that they have an outdoor space as well with plenty of seating, under the sun and under the shade. Industrial feel with cute little plants, some artwork, TV and music, but the sound isn't overwhelming. Love to come here to study or work. The staff is always nice and welcoming as well. Decent prices for it's location in the CWE!",5,Positive
"
The coffee was exceptional! Great atmosphere and energy. The staff were sweet as well. The seating... not so good in the winter months. Would love to see them expand a bit, but until then, a great place to go to meet up with friends or just get some work done.",5,Positive
"
A lovely spot we discovered, with great coffee, delicious waffles, and a friendly community-focused vibe. It has a patio with cool fans and shades. Perfect to enjoy a socially-distanced brunch! Have to try the waffles!",5,Positive
"
Such a cute little spot! The employees were very nice and helped me pick the right iced espresso. I also had a turkey bacon and egg wrap (it was okay). I would definitely visit again!",5,Positive
"
This place I finally went in was the best the soup was good my smoothie was good and my husband coffee well he said it was great they grind their own the guy wait on us he was  and helpful and friendly made us feel welcome ❤️♥️",5,Positive
"
On my search for a great coffee shop in St. Louis, this place had been recommended for me to try. My only regret is that I didn't try Northwest sooner! The espresso is richly flavored and the coffee is delicious, smooth and contains not a hint of bitterness. The staff is friendly and attentive. The outside patio is inviting and cozy. I am so happy to have found quality coffee in St. Louis!",5,Positive
"
Solid cup of coffee, and a great atmosphere. I also did a photo shoot here for Warm Soda Magazine and I'm not sure if it's standard to notify the business ahead of time to do this or not, but they were very friendly and  accommodating. They only asked that I credit their space once the pictures/magazine was released.",5,Positive
"
Really great place. Owner is very friendly and passionate about their business. They have a lot of great things planned for the future.

The coffee is incredible, they specialize in medium to dark roasts. Truly third wave stuff going on here, not just another Starbucks clone.

Bonus: they have a pokestop.",5,Positive
"
One of our favorite places for coffee in St. Louis. A bit of nostalgia for us as well - we severed up their beans in our shop in Columbia, MO.",5,Positive
"
A unique coffeeshop! A lot of outside seating (great during the pandemic) and nice food and drink options! Very friendly staff and a convenient microphone so you can hear when your order is being called.",5,Positive

Owner, Jason, was so helpful and kind!  Thank you for helping me make my daughter's day!",5,Positive
"
This is one of my favorite places in St. Louis to get coffee. The atmosphere, taste of the coffee and variety on the menu, everything is on point.",5,Positive
"
I like to order coffee beans online. I've tried fancy brands from Portland, SF, and NYC. I think Northwest Coffee is so much better in every way – the freshness, the aroma of the beans, the aroma of brewing, the aroma in the cup, and the taste when you take that first sip. Thank you!",5,Positive
"
Quite simply the best coffee I've ever had. It's not bitter at all. I can't explain it and I don't care. Try the Mocha Bianca and tell me I'm wrong.

Service and atmosphere was a bit bland but the food is simple, wholesome and cooked to order so that plus the coffee make this 5 stars to me.",5,Neutral
"
Very unique coffee shop tucked into the CWE. Great coffee served by friendly staff. They have a great selection of both coffee items and non-coffee items including a breakfast/brunch menu, and also some delicious baked goods!",5,Positive
"
Excellent coffee and smoothies. Great food. Very nice people work here. Covid-aware; low key, easy to get to.",5,Positive

"
Great place to sit and work.

They have really good coffee drinks and smoothies.

Love that they have the printer. It's really helpful.

Staff are friendly.

They have time if electrical suckers for your laptop, just awkwardly placed.",5,Positive
"
I ordered online and had a bag shipped to me. It is some of the best coffee I’ve had. Their Mocha Java is my new favorite  coffee, hands down. Will definitely reorder.",5,Positive
"
My favorite place to hang out and read or study. Close enough to SLU's campus to walk if you want but also far enough to be away from it all. The place is eclectic looking and really comfortable, unlike other local coffee shops which can sometimes feel too sterile or too ""hipster"" for your average Joe. The coffee is great as well and the newish barista eggs are a great addition.",5,Positive
"
Very pleasant coffee and breakfast house with a great use of space for outdoor seating. The baristas make very good coffee and other breakfast drinks. Staff is friendly and professional.",5,Positive
"
Amazing coffee with awesome service. Already asked my friends to ship me some more of their coffee beans!",5,Positive
"
I've been getting my espresso beans from NW Coffee Roasting for the last couple of months.   They roast every week, and so far the quality has been very consistent.  They sell their roasts in 1/4 pound denominations, I like that too.  Support your local coffee roasters!",5,Positive
"
Had a really great Ethiopian cold brew. Surprised me with pleasant chocolaty notes which I felt to be unusual with the rest of the coffee. Overall a really good cold brew. Also tried some of their hot coffee recently. I have to say, it was awesome. I historically hate all wet hulled coffees (the prevalent processing mehod in Sumatra), but after trying their Sumatran it alone has changed my mind. Northwest should definitely be on your list of stops to make while in Saint Louis.",5,Positive
"
My favorite neighborhood cafe in the city. I may be partial because I'm walking distance, but the owner and staff are great, the coffee is excellent (favorite drip coffee in StL), and reassuring measures put into place during the pandemic.",5,Positive
"
Cold brew and lattes are great.  The outdoor seating is wonderful.  Super friendly and inviting.  Biggest jade plant ever right by the door.",5,Positive
"
i purchased 5 lbs of ethiopian yirgacheffe. my local roaster supplies these beans as well, but i felt it was time for me to support black-owned business. i located this company via a website that promotes black-owned businesses and ordered on 7/31 at noon.

i received notification on 8/5 that my package had shipped, and received my package that following saturday (i live in chs, sc), delivered via usps.

i brewed my first pot yesterday and it's just as good as what i can get locally, if not better. the packages indicate the beans were fresh-roasted on the day i placed my order. they are supremely fresh, just amazing.

i will continue to purchase from northwest and will recommend it to friends. thank you, jason!",5,Positive

This place was great! The owner was really nice and the atmosphere was fantastic. Hoping to visit again soon with my wife!",5,Positive
"
I was introduced to Northwest coffee by my older sister. I used to visit the Blumeyer location frequently and was sad when it closed. However I was excited to learn Farmstead, on the BJC medical campus, was selling Northwest so I could get my daily cup of Northwest coffee. I visited the Central West End location for the first time this week and it was a very pleasant experience from the greeting when I walked through the door till I left with my coffee in hand!",5,Positive
"
This was my go-to spot for years when I lived here (and when I visit). The location is good funky (former garage with roll-up doors and concrete floor). The main attraction, the coffee, is the BEST. They roast their own beans to perfection in addition to offering food items. If you're looking for a local coffeeshop to drop in to, this is it. Free wi-fi, customer appreciation (buy 12, 1 free) and cool, laidback vibe make this a spot you should add to your St. Louis to-do and done list.",5,Positive
"
Chill, authentic little place with great atmosphere and delicious, smokey sweet coffees. Best waffle my girlfriend ever had. Also makes you just a little bit cooler than you were before entering.",5,Positive

Clearly, one of the best roasters in the Midwest.  I love the CWE location because it's got the neighborhood coffee shop vibe.  A great place to sit down and enjoy your cuppa morning joe.  WiFi, outdoor seating as well as indoor - very nice.",5,Positive

Wonderful, cozy little coffee shop. Good prices, delicious drinks, refreshing atmosphere and wonderful employees.  Tucked away in the central west end but a wonderful little gem. Will definitely be returning!",5,Positive

Cozy, spacious, and lots of personality. This place is a little gem, and the lavender latte was very good. The coffee is roasted on site, which flavors the experience. There’s a lot of heart that goes into roasting, and you can feel it infused into the space!",5,Positive
Do not go here unless you wanna waste your money. I ordered one of the signature flavors and got absolutely ripped off. The employee who made my order had absolutely no idea what he was doing and was able to give me this pile of mush with a straight face. This gives Cold Stone a bad reputation and I will never go to one again. I advise you do the same.,1,Negative
"This place is an absolute JOKE. The line is always out the door because the employees are just standing there chatting. I ordered for pickup & had to wait 10 extra minutes for our order just for the ice cream to be completely melted when they handed it to us. I also ordered a waffle bowl for my ice cream and did not receive it. I called immediately and mentioned this, however they said they don’t have waffle bowls (even though i paid extra for this). They told me if i wanted a refund i would need to come in and pay for it again, which makes no sense. The customer service was an absolute mockery and they tried to gaslight me into thinking it wasn’t ordered from their location. They said i can leave a message for the manager. I hope this place goes out of business and a business with better customer service takes its place.",1,Negative
"Went to Cold Stone in Mt Laurel today and ordered 5 “like it” ice creams, the register said it was $31 and change yet they charged my debit card $35 and change.  What was the extra $4 for, if you go here make sure you check your receipt…i feel ripped off!!!",1,Negative
"The product quality is good, but the service and cleanliness always lacks when I go to this location. I will not every go back to this location. Do not recommend go to location in Mt Laurel if you don't have 20 minutes to wait since there is usually only one person serving while the rest work on online orders.",1,Negative
Such slow service it’s insane. This one girl was so mean when we ordered she literally rolled her eyes and went “ugh”. like what!!!!!!! it toon the workers 40 minutes to clear a line of five people because of how much they were messing around. good ice cream but not worth the bad service.,1,Negative
"It’s 8, the store closes at 9 pm but the they said they were closed at 8?? ONLY  for DOORDASH. Why is the door wide open then? 2 girls serving behind the counter, why not close the door maybe” if you are closed at 8”.",1,Negative
"Store is supposed to be open until 9, the door was locked around 8. The two girls inside just stared at me. Put a sign up or update the hours online",1,Negative
"Was very disappointed. I wanted a waffle cone, yet when i glanced at the waffle cone maker, i noticed it hasn’t been cleaned, maybe ever. This machine was so clumped with burnt mix that you couldn’t even see the waffle print. How is this acceptable? How is this safe? Sanitary?",1,Negative
"Went to treat my little boy to some ice cream tonight, hours listed said they closed at 9:30, we were there at 9:05 the door was locked. Workers still inside. We weren’t the only ones either another couple pulled up shortly after we did.",1,Negative
"I use to love Cold Stone but I have to say I think it time for them to call it quits!  The store is very dirty.  The ice Cream is half melted.  My ice cream was suppose to have 3 toppings,  it was missing one and barely had any of the other two.  I’m glad I had to throw it away cause I probably would have contracted something if I had eaten it!",1,Negative
Went here with my girlfriend and she got cotton candy with gummy bears. She found peanut butter in her ice cream which she is very allergic to. They clearly don’t clean up much. Tried calling to maybe get that ice cream money back but they basically said it’s our fault,1,Negative
"Was served soupy ice cream and told ""that's just the way it is"", offered no replacement or anything. The manager went on to ignore me completely. Terrible customer service",1,Negative
"Their Love It size became more of a Like It and today the marshmallows in the ice cream my kid got were hard as rock, obviously stale. Also we went over about two weeks ago at 2:20pm as their site showed they open at 2:00, yet doors were locked with employees inside. I called in to ask thought they forgot to unlock the door, but the lady said they’ll open later maybe in half hour… really? Needless to say we will no longer visit this location",1,Negative
"Went a few hours ago, they had one person working, who was clearly new. I completely understand places being understaffed but it was sickening to see how stressed the employee was trying to help guests while figure things out. I had to read her the ingredients for the ice cream we were ordering while she made it. After only a couple of bites, I noticed a long hair in my food, I felt bad returning with an issue to the already stressed employee. She couldn't issue a refund because she was the only one there and had no authorization on the computer. I offered to just switch it out for something different but then she couldn't find the supplies to do this either. Eventually a manager called her back to give me a refund, but she didn't remember how much she had charged me, so I had to remind her. Horrible experience not only for my family, but for the employee.",1,Negative
"Ordered online at 5 today, said my order would be ready 5:18. Get there at 5:25 just to sit for 5 minutes trying to find my receipt because they never got my order, to say they’d work on it right away and it will be done in 5 minutes. Not only did that not happen, they took everyone that was in the stores ordered first. Mind you the traffic kept coming in and still nothing. 20 minutes later they start working on my order. I left at 5:40, get home and they made it incorrect. I asked for the regular apple pic a la mode, received pumpkin ice cream, 1 apple and chunks of “cookie” that don’t belong in there. I should have been the first priority as I had placed my order 20 minutes prior to arrival, and we’ll before any of the 15+ customers that came in after me. Disgrace.",1,Negative
Terrible customer service and rude staff. Store closes at 9 PM according to listed hours. I walked through the door at 8:36 PM with 2 customers in front of me and they asked me leave.,1,Negative
My wife and I visited the place on Friday July 22nd we were VERY DISAPPOINTED the place was dimly lit sticky tables and chairs dull colors nothing that says come on in and enjoy some icecream and the icecream is subpar icecream not creamy Meadowlands in Delran and the Mapleshade icecream stand has much better icecream a nice rich flavor don't waste your gas and time going to the  coldstone creamy,1,Negative
"If I could leave 0 stars, I would. Went in, received my icecream only to find a long blond hair in it. I go back in and the staff is completely rude, didn’t apologize, even laughed in my face. I return to ask if the managers or owners number is that on the door, the girl proceeded to say go ahead and call the manager and tell him I told you too! The rest of the staff stood there laughing. I own a business and would NEVER employ people in my establishment with such attitudes! I will be calling corporate.The 4 girls working behind the counter were absolutely miserable and rude as ever.  DON’T spend your money at this location.",1,Negative
We walked in and it was empty.  Some wired racks in a fridge.  Sone tubs missing from the freezer where they keep all the flavors.  It was dirty but what was really disgusting was that one or 2 flavors had either melted and watery.   I'm husband and I loved cold stone from back in the day out in PA.  This was my kids first time and last time. He wanted a milk shake.  They didn't have milk.  The place looked like it was closed from the outside.  I really wanted to be a fun experience but if the ice cream has freezer burn or is melting I dnt want to try it.  So we ended up at a Rita's.,1,Negative
We paid 8 dollars for soup in a waffle cone.  It was obvious the individual making what we ordered had little idea on how to do so.  Much training is needed here; we won't be returning any time soon.,1,Negative
"Customer service needs major improvement. Placed an online order due to quarantine restrictions and placed order in my car in the parking lot. I waited the 17 minutes of my ""asap"" order and called in for the young lady to have an apathetic attitude. She was super short with me and said that I would have to come inside and wait in the long line because they didn't start online orders yet and there were only two people. I told her that defeated my purpose of the order and that I placed my order prior to the line beginning and requested my order be cancelled. So far my account still shows the order is completed and my points are no longer available that I used for my order!

Please find new staff.

**Update** checking my bank statement and was charged for the purchase. I called earlier in the week and a young lady told me it shows that the order was cancelled on her end and that a manager would call me later when they came in.l regarding my points. Six days later and I have yet to receive an order, phone call or return of my money.",1,Negative
"My husband and I went today to get ice cream at 8pm (they were supposed to be open til 9pm). We were waiting in a line outside and there were even people showing up after us but we were turned away, along with others.  The young girl at the door saying they weren’t taking any more customers and that they were closed. A lot of people walked away disappointed. Not sure how you can just turn customers away after such a difficult year. This experience doesn’t make me eager to return.",1,Negative
Called today to put my cake order since I was not able to order online. Guy was rude said they r busy call after 15 min. He was in his office he could have took order. Gave my order to another cold stone location. Never going to order from here and also there prices r very high compare to other location.,1,Negative
"This location has one employee who is the rudest most unwelcoming individual. She should quit. She rolls her eyes when you ask questions about the ice cream and mix in substitutes. To make matters worse i call the owner of the store Glenn Brougham and he's rude,no wonder she has a job still. He didn't even ask who the attendant was,i tried to make sure the wrong person wasn't reprimanded but he didn't need a description he knew who it was which lets me know that kind of customer service is tolerated. This location isn't even clean like the others anymore I think this location is the worse so far. My $$$ will be spent elsewhere.",1,Negative
"On the last five of our six visits over the past few months, it seems like not one person behind the counter had been trained on how to do anything. From mixing items as described on the menu to taking orders from people in the same order as they are standing in line to ringing up an order, it all seems like someone snuck behind the counter after watching someone mix ice cream in a movie that morning. There has been one employee there consistently on every visit, but I haven't seen any other person behind the counter twice. We have witnessed the one consistent employee making herself food without gloves during a rush (a line up to the front door) and eating it while standing behind the counter.
Basically, consider getting something else for dessert or, if you must have Cold Stone Creamery, be prepared to coach the staff through getting your order right, charging you correctly and, if you're going with one or more other people, get one of the people behind the counter to help the people in your group before they skip to the people behind you as this will be such a long process, the first person in your group will have melted ice cream by the time the second or last person has paid.",1,Negative
"The hours say that they're open at 1, but my daughter and I showed up at 1:45 and they didn't let us in and someone was inside. After we walked back to our car, the employee called us to come back only to ask us if we ordered a cake. We said no, and she said they were closed and only making cakes, when it doesn't say that on their website . Very disappointed, never returning",1,Negative
While my service and product were both excellent the wait was unacceptable.  There was a young girl working all by herself at 500PM. I understand it's winter but on a day where the weather is proposed to be 25 to 30 degrees higher then normal there should have be others there. Also totally unsafe to leave anyone on their own at anytime. I commend the server I had she kept a great attitude but as the line grew she became a bit frazzled.,1,Negative
This place once was my favorite ice cream place knowing what I know about the cleanliness I wouldn't eat here even if it's free. The owner is very disrespectful to his employees along with his wife. They refuse to purchase needed items for the store in order to have it run properly. I really think corporate along with the health department should give them a visit.,1,Negative
"My mother-in-law had an abysmal experience at the CSC in Mt. Laurel, NJ. She ordered a cake 2 days in advance and was told it would be ready by 1:00 PM; however, she waited 45 minutes and by the time she arrived at her destination (20 mins) all the ganache had melted as well as a portion of the cake itself!",1,Negative
Do not come here. Terrible customer service because we went in at 8:45pm with 2 customers still being served and they told us they would not serve us despite them closing at 9pm. We asked if we could just have 1 cup of ice cream and they said no because they were doing their last customer. Ridiculous,1,Negative
"Very Slow, Not enough workers and Terrible Costumer Service.",1,Negative
The new owner has taking this place down! Please don’t waste your time and money. And he was very ignorant,1,Negative
"Slowest workers I have ever seen, the line was out the door and the two people working behind the counter were dragging their feet. They ran out of the most popular flavors and after waiting in line for 35 minutes we couldn't get what we wanted and they didn't seem to care. I stick with Rita's from now on.",1,Negative
"Showed up at 7:20 and the guy working there had the lights off, just standing behind the counter. Guess he decided to lock the store ip 40 mins early. Won't be back.",1,Negative
"Huge disappointment. My girlfriend took me out for ice cream, so we decided to go to Cold-stone. Usually I think of cold stone as a very mature professional, yet quality place! So we show up and and order our ice cream. Their ice cream is displayed very poorly. Some of the ice creams, literally looked like the poop emoji. So I asked for chocolate and butterfinger, my favorite combo. And they were out of butterfinger. They said that they had the display butterfinger, and said that they would gladly give me the expired butterfinger. How does a Coldstone run out of an ingridenient. That's like a Italian restaurant running out of Spaghetti. For a cone and a small ice cream bowl, it costed us $10 after military discount. And the Ice cream was disgusting, we both threw ours away after tasting it. Also, there was no tables outside, just chairs, how inconvenient. The staff was VERY disrespectful, and unfortunately unprofessional. I am sad to have invested $10 into such a shame of an ice cream shop. Please, do not go here, and instead go to smoothie king next door if you feel like not wasting money.",1,Negative
Walked up trash cans all overflowing. Trash was everywhere out front. The signs were broken. The employee had an open bowl of the ice cram mix with bugs. We walked in and walked out this is horrible.,1,Negative
Would recommend eating here if you don’t mind eating anything expired or unsanitary. Also the cakes are definitely a must buy if you like it being made by people who don’t work at Coldstone and are paid in cash by the owner in the back of the store but I mean that’s not shady right?,1,Negative
"Bad service , I waited for my Uber eat order for 30 minutes , the staff keeping take orders in front of me ,when I asked the girl about the manager she ignored me",1,Negative
"Ordered cake a few weeks in advance for a birthday. When I went to pick up, I was told they did not receive the order.",1,Negative
"I drove over here from mount holly, arriving at 8:39 pm on a Wednesday. Both the sign and online say open until 9, but the employee had locked the door and was looking at me through it like an idiot while he closed up. Bearded guy. Hope management sees this.",1,Negative
"It says it opens at 12 and yet when I
come here 10 or 15 minutes past 12 the door is still locked",1,Negative
yall gotta figure something out with taking a number and a display or something cause waited out in 25 degree weather for 30 minutes then another 15 inside before i got 1 ice cream. covid or not acceptable,1,Negative
"VERY UNPROFFESIONAL ! Ordered a ice cream cake for my birthday and not only was my name spelled wrong but my cake was also MELTED ! Associate that answered the phone answered the phone saying ""What do you want""",1,Negative
"Girl took a Heath bar out of the display case and chopped it into my ice cream, tasted old as hell, would not be surprised if it has been there since it has been open",1,Negative
The girls working there on May 18th are rude with zero care. They probably shouldn’t work in a customer service environment dealing with people day to day.,1,Negative
Terrible customer service. Such a shame because the food is delicious but everyone who works there seems so miserable.,1,Negative
They did not have any vanilla ice cream or sweet cream!?!?! How does an ice cream shop run out of one the base flavors,1,Negative
"Horrible,,would not go there ever again...they have people that dont even know what they are doing...ice cream melted...lid off..he made a whole mess. 0 stars from me and my coworkers",1,Negative
Not participating in the national ice cream day. Drove 40 min. Not that many toppings disaponting.,1,Negative

Went in and no one was around. Hollered hello three times after waiting for five minutes I left I couldn't see anyone in the back wonder if anyone was there?,1,Negative
"Listing says curbside pick up, when I called to try to get curbside they said they do not do that. And would not bring to my car.",1,Negative

"I rarely give bad reviews but this was just an unpleasant experience and didn't need to be.  I had a coupon for a buy one get one with the location listed on the back of the coupon.

First I was told they don't take the coupon, I explained that the location was listed on the coupon.

Next I was told there's no code for it almost like I was being made to give in and not get the free item.

The coupon allowed for a free love it with purchase of a love it or greater item,  considering I ordered a quart I felt that's not that big a deal but the person tried to make me order a love it in addition to the quart to get the love it.

Finally, when I paid I was told one price initially, and then the total was different for what I was charged.  As a line had more formed (no one was in there when I went in) I felt like it was time to leave rather then try and figure out where the extra 2-3 dollar Charges came from.

I feel after reading the reviews this is not the first or last time there is some questionable service occurring, I would not recommend going here and that takes a lot from me.",1,Negative
"Me and my friend took our 2 kids, we were serviced by a new girl. I am not sure if this issue was with her or the establishment but we ended up very sick after eating our ice cream! I called to today to let the manager know to prevent others from getting sick and was told “they had over 100 customers yesterday and I am only one who complained, sorry for inconvenience you being sick” this is a total joke. There is definitely a contamination in their products. Beware!",1,Negative
Place needs a total refresh and overhaul. Sign outside is broken the refrigerators inside we’re mostly empty flooring needs steam cleaning and more employees are needed to keep the line from starting outside. Counter glass was dirty and a total “take down” needs to happen to clean. Ice cream is still good. The corporate office should make a visit. As a franchise I would think it would have been better represented.,2,Neutral
"Long line that didn't move, all 3 workers had airpods in. It was really awkward to watch TWO doordash workers be ignored until they had to leave. No management in sight. After about 10 minutes and no movement we left.",2,Negative
"No dine in…chairs on top of tables.
So if you plan on eating outside, it will be melted before you get it out of the bag.",2,Negative
"Not impressed with this location and I've been to plenty of them in various states.  The lighting is so dim inside, from the outside I thought it was closed. Very dreary and uninviting atmosphere. As far as the ice cream goes, it's all the same across Cold Stones. Where this one varies is the mix ins that staff hesitantly rations out. If you order a bigger serving, mix in proportions should be increased to match. This location should pick up the standards to meet the brand.",2,Negative
"I have ordered three birthday cakes and occasionally go for icecream.  I was called and informed twice that they didn't have an ingredient for the birthday cakes. Today I ordered a love it sized icecream cup. I asked for a cover for the icecream.  The employee stated they didn't have covers for that size and didn't offer foil, cling wrap another cup, anything that would cover my icecream.",2,Negative
"Normally cold stone would get 5stars for flavor and quality alone. I must say the mt.laurel location usually has good friendly service but lately it has deff. Not been as good lately. The last two times they have messed up my pt.and bigger orders. Both visits were mons.apart - the most recent visit was yesterday 03/03/21. I took my older son in with me there was one younger lady working,we were only ones in the store.The worker was not only short answered, slightly unpleasant as a server she seemed down right miserable to be there in general or maybe just miserable in general. Not only did she manage to make myself and my 13 yr old feel as if we were an annoyance just being there,let alone placing an order but she also managed to mess up the order - after having me repeat myself to her and her repeating it back to me correctly.Worst part - it wasn't until after we were home we realized the order was wrong - you see, after she did my son's love it size order,the repeating back and forth of the 2 others,and her starting them,that we turned our backs to look at the cakes and ready made options in that short time period she managed to mess up the order by 1.ignoring my request completely (birthday cake remix -yellow cake instead of brownies) & 2.by doing the exact opposite of what was asked on the lucky charms order(yellow cake in place of whip cream,extra cake(didn't happen),leave other reg lucky charms mix-ins only use very little of them(marshmallows & gold dust) instead barely any cake and was filled with marshmallows - didn't notice any gold dust.",2,Negative
"Totally annoying that you go there BEFORE closing time and they will not let you in the door and staff say they are already closed. Arrived at 8:44 and the store closes at 9:00. We were told we could not come in by someone manning the door. She said they close at 8:45. Bull! That is ridiculous! It has happened to us before at this location, last time it was 10 minutes prior to closing. Either way, it is out of line. If you want time for employees to close up and clean and to pay them less for that or something, post an earlier closing time.",2,Negative
The one girl with the pony tail and the red lips was absolutely wonderful! I must comment however how the management allows their employees to be treated. Some customers are disrespect and just out right rude. While I love the place and the employees I cannot bring myself to want to give funds to a company that allows such behavior and mistreatment of the staff. If you love ice cream and good service then by all means come here but if you value human decency take your business to a place that respects it within their own work place.,2,Neutral
"My sister and I took our kids here last night, it's the second time we've been here and it will probably be our last. There were 6 people behind the counter and 5 people in line and it still took 20 minutes for us to even get served. But what really made us mad was the one girl chewing gum, completely open mouthed. Right over the ice cream she was mixing. And she chewed the entire time. The only reason we didn't leave right then was because we got another person to serve us. She did a great job and we were happy with that. So my review is based off of the cleanliness aspect, you shouldn't chew gum around food and the wait time. The ice cream was delicious.",2,Negative
The ice cream is amazing of course but this specific location is disgusting. It looks like they haven't cleaned the place in weeks! Garbage and dirty untensils litter the back counters. Ice cream and finger prints cover every counter and table out front. Not sure what is happening with management here but this place is taking a turn for the worse. I recommend finding another Cold Stone to purchase from.,2,Negative
"Went here just after they have opened for the day and the place was extremely dirty. The display glass, counters, tables and frozen stone they mix the ice cream was still dirty from the previous business day.",2,Negative

"Ordered a custom made birthday cake, unfortunately the presentation left something to be desired. Wouldn’t recommend fruit for topping. It tasted great until we found hair in it.",3,Negative
This place has good ice cream but is a bit on the expensive side. It's in a strange location and feels like it's always on the verge of closing down. It's also not the cleanest place either. I don't know how else to describe it.,3,Negative
"Not what it once was. Slow service, place is messy. Ice cream is good if you can wait.",3,Negative
So dark in there you don't even know it's open.  Wish they hadn't closed the one at The Promenade in Marlton,3,Negative

"Cold Stone Creamery's Mount Laurel, NJ, location was nice. The location is a bit small, but it was fairly clean for a late Saturday night. The two servers there were courteous to customers despite the more crowded it became last night. I don't know if there's a restroom for customers, so I cannot say whether it too was clean or not. The ice cream I had tasted fresh and was very creamy. The only negative I have is the price. The price is a bit high for what you're getting, but it's not that much different from what one would pay for Bassett Ice Cream (which is SO GOOD (!!!)) at Reading Terminal Market either. I look forward to visiting again to try other flavors and signature creations.",4,Positive

I’ve visited this location multiple times and each time I’ve had a wait of 45 + minutes. Even when they aren’t busy you somehow still have a wait of at least 20 mins. Certain staff members can be very rude and will ignore you if you have a question or trying to explain something is missing in your order. The last time I ate here I ordered a bagel with cream cheese through doordash and they basically gave me a plain bagel with nothing on it. There is another Dunkin location just 5 minutes from this one which is wayyy better!,1,Negative
"Three people at the counter for morning rush, whom don't seem to work well together.  They usually do an okay job if rather slow.  Today however it was chaos.  The mobile order tickets were all over, orders seemed to come out in random order, lids weren't put on tightly.  The crew looked upset to have to hustle instead of being happy to be working.  I will take my business elsewhere from now on.",1,Negative
Walked in at 5:30 pm .  There was no selection of donuts and it seemed like most of it was tossed for closing already even though the location had 90 minutes remaining. Seems like the owner needs to adjust the closing time  since the place was basically closed down by 5 pm.,1,Negative
This location does not honor the hours posted on their door nor online. I am here at 5:10 AM and there is simply no one inside AND they allow online ordering so there were people here who paid and were unable to get their food. Pay people more to show up at work.,1,Negative
"For the third time in recent months, I arrived to this Dunkin at 6:10 (opening hours on door say 5am), after having placed a mobile order, only to find the lights off and the store closed. There were several customers, all of whom had also placed mobile orders, standing outside while there appeared to be 2 employees inside stocking shelves. Not one of them bothered to come to the door to explain the delay in opening the store or to at least tell us how much longer it would be until they opened. Some of us have to go to work and don’t have 20 mins to wait to find out if our orders will be filled. This is the third time this has happened to me and each time I have to go through customer service on the app to get my money back. I don’t understand why the app accepts orders if the store isn’t open. Fix it! Don’t recommend this Dunkin.",1,Negative
"They took forever to get me my frozen coffee and when they finally did it was not frozen but a cold coffee,  I don't know if the staff here is new, but I will never return and kitchen was dirty from where I was standing",1,Negative
Terrible location. Waiting for 20min plus and finally walked out. Didn’t even request a refund. The folks standing at the register waiting to order were even there for 15min. Very slow staff. And they were out of everything.,1,Negative
"It's a horrible service, a curly-haired America girl.  , blue eyes.  She is a girl with a terrible attitude. She took my order badly. I told her to change. She started acting rude with her faces. After she changed my order, she didn't make my drinks. He did not wash his hands, he began to serve the other customers and never gave us our drinks",1,Negative
"Worst ever experience!!!

The two individuals who were working this morning completely lack competence, attention to detail, and most of all customer service. When you open the door for business in the morning, how hard is it to turn on the toaster oven? Also they can't make proper breakfast sandwiches.

When you ask for a manager, their response is no one is in charge.
However, what really takes the cake is they don't have the nerve to ensure people wear a protective mask to ensure everyone's health is taken seriously due to COVID19....smh",1,Negative
This Dunkin is the absolute worst of the worst. They hire anybody off the street. Literally work around the corner so I come here sometimes to get breakfast and it’s always 15-20 min wait even if you have two ppl ahead of you. Last week my co worker went inside to Chic fila next store and he was able to get 5 orders for other employees at our job faster then I could get a coffee and a donut so just imagine that. Your Dunkin’ Donuts has taking the longest amount of time out of every single other one I been to. Clean your stuff up and actually read these comments. Hire ppl that want to work and are not there just for a paycheck.,1,Negative
"Always over 20 mins to get anything from here in the morning, have seen over 10 different staff members over the last year and they seem to have a niche for finding people that take several minutes to prepare each order. There is never one person designated to a register making the line to order alone 15 mins minimum after 6:30 AM. Why does the register person have to stop taking orders after each individual order to take 5 mins to make a coffee when there is two people working on food.... This location is an embarrassment. Take the extra 5 min drive to the other nursery road location if you would like to save your self a considerable amount of time.",1,Negative
Super slow service DONT COME HERE. Almost 25 minute wait for an iced green tea. Literally just put ice in cup then tea in cup.,1,Negative
"Definitely a horrible experience. Arrived at 9am the day after July 4th and didn't leave until after 9:30am. We were first in line and it was 8-10 min before our order was taken (2 orders of hash browns and 2 medium lattes). After, it was apparent that they were backed up by mobile orders that they didn't remember to do until the customer or door dasher walked in the door. There were 2 women making drinks and one making food (the one making food was great!). The other two moved awfully slow and gave customers attitudes the entire time. I would not recommend wasting your time here. Go to Chickfila or Starbucks for coffee.",1,Negative
This place is terrible with bad coffe and overly flirty guy thats at the check out. Definitely a no no,1,Negative
"I can not say I have ever had a good to great experience here.  I go there when I’m in Maryland.  I had an absolutely terrible experience on Monday, August 31.  My order was taken very quickly, but it was at least 25 mins before I got my regular and decaf coffees.  At one point they realized they had no coffee and had to make some.  Once I finally got my coffees I left.  down the road I realized that one of my coffees was missing sugar and the other had so much sweetened creamer that it tasted like candy.   I vowed that on future visits I would go to Starbucks or 7-11.  There was a trainee working that day, but there was also 4 other employees.  I realize your online business is important, but you need to serve your in person employees within a decent timeframe.  I do not recommend this location.",1,Negative
"Worst experience ever. Placed a mobile order for a Chai Latte, and walked out with coffee.
Went back to let them know my order was incorrect and I was received very negatively. There was no remorse shown for having gotten my order wrong, and I wasn’t even acknowledged when I came back.
When you stand in the pickup line, good luck trying to get someone to recognize that you’re there. Busy or not, that staff is rude & arrogant.",1,Negative
"One of the worst Dunkin's you can go to. Don't think about placing a mobile order within an hour of them opening because a) they usually open 30 to 40 minutes late and b) the mobile order station is behind the counter so you can't just grab and go, and you must wait for someone to not be busy in order for them to give you your drink. I have to call Dunkin' support at least once a week now in order to get my money back because the store still isn't open by the time I get there. They were put under new management in May/June because of this same issue but at least they allowed customer's to get their drinks and go, and not have to wait for someone to give it to you.

They also just bumped up all of their drink prices to even more than Baltimore City and Towson which is absolutely insane. Nothing like charging more for even less quality.",1,Negative
"Horrible experience. They need at least 3 people working between 7-11. One for the register, one for coffee/ barista and one on the food. I left after 7 minutes just waiting to be acknowledged and take my order. You would do better going down the road and spending more money on Starbucks. I don’t fault the employees. I fault poor management.",1,Negative
"As someone with a history in customer service, I have never been more appalled at the combativeness from this location’s supervisor(Anthony). His own associates outclass and over qualify him by far!

I work at Amazon air and after a long overnight shift went in to grab a coffee to stay awake on the drive home. With only one other customer in line and no one else in the shop besides me he took their order and started making it.

—My problem was that he didn’t give a simple “someone will be right with you sir” which allowed a woman to come in and take my place in line. I was seated and being a man I simply allowed the woman to go first. He acted as though I wasn’t there and even when I told him how he could’ve handled it he didn’t show one sign of empathy or remorse which baffled me and caused me to lose my cool.

I tried to talk to him in a cooler tone, still condescending and combative. I even came in after my shift the next day to patronize the store and tell him what I’d been through. He chose instead to remain argumentative.

I’m sure that if someone disagrees that he has an air impoliteness around him they are not a person of color. With every occasion between us having hardly any fast paced business I believe I am right to write this review seeing as I’ve only ever written negative or possible reviews when I have been extremely inspired to do so. But maybe Anthony can digest how he comes off better through reading than speaking.",1,Negative
Please get rid of the person who is working the front cashier. I have never seen a person move so slow in my entire life. This young lady was moving like molasses even when there was a long line. I am sure if you look at your cameras you would see that was unacceptable especially for it to be almost 8am when people are trying to get to work. Please hire people who actually want to work and can provide fast service. It should not take 6 minutes to fill a 12 dozen box of doughnuts. I just walked out of the store because I would have been in there until lunch time dealing with her.,1,Negative
"Zero stars. Two days in a row I pay for your coffee and snacks through door dash and it never arrives. I was told by the door dash both times that they went inside to find no staff even on the property, and I am just expected to sit by while I lose my money twice. How can you run a store and let some guest who doesn’t even work there monitor your store. How can your response be to tell the dasher oh I don’t know when he even stated items were missing. Some seriously corruption here. I will be contacting corporate. Unbelievably horrible service.",1,Negative
They don't know how to make good latter or cappuccino. Rude employees as well. Not gonna come back to that place again.,1,Negative
The most trash Dunkin’ Donuts I’ve ever been to and I’ve been all over. They dress dirty have backpacks on while working and spend more time gossiping then working. Unfortunately this is the closest to me when I’m in time and they disgust me even more then the last. I’m done!,1,Negative
It’s was closed without any notification. I waited for almost 30min and I saw a lot of customers getting mad because they couldn’t buy their breakfast.,1,Negative
"The young lady at the register is vary rude and lazy. She refuses to do anything even with a full shop. She also was insulting customers as I was waiting for my order, for asking her to do her job. She and her other female worker are very slow and get orders constantly wrong.  This was at 6:30am and the young blond woman is always there at this time.",1,Negative
My experience at this location was horrible. I tried to order donuts and the cashier laughed as she told me they only had the few donuts that were up there. Ok fine. I then ordered 2 frozen drinks and there was plastic in them as if they were blended with a plastic bag. I even showed them proof of the plastic! When I go back and ask for a refund I’m told I have to call the next day and talk to someone else because they don’t have the authority to give refunds they are just employees. That’s actually what they told me. But I’m gonna call back tomorrow. I guess we’ll see if they are gonna actually show some customer service or tell me to call someone else??,1,Negative
"I placed an order online using DoorDash around 930 and did not receive it until 1130. My Dasher was waiting there for most of that time and said they were busy. BUT the way I see it, I am also a paying customer and my order should have been made in the order it was recieved. After my order came 2 hours later, it had the wrong items in it and everything was ice cold. I do not recommend this location.",1,Negative
"I was told my coffee had cleaning chemicals in it by the staff after I handed it back to the them because of the horrible taste!!! Needless to say, I left the coffee with the staff and asked for my money back, but they said they didn't know how to refund money and told me to contact the store manager. When the manager returned my calls, she assured me that she would issue a refund. But that never happened, so I contacted Dunkin Donuts customer service and was told that the store filed a report with them saying that I personally went into the store, where she handed me cash for the coffee, which never happened because I never went back to that store. You may want to think twice about going to this store - their cleaning habits, by their own admission, are poor and their honesty and desire to do the right thing equally as bad. Worst experience ever, in any food establishment, if it were possible to give less than one star I certainly would, I'm making this post in the hope that others will not pay money to be treated so poorly.",1,Negative
"Walk in and young lady is sweeping behind the counter with her ear buds in. Finally acknowledges me and I order a medium ice coffee. ""Sorry we don't have any"". Not sorry the ice machine is broken, we are out of cups or I just don't feel like it. Nothing! It's coffee over ice. What ingredient are you missing that's keeping you from filling this request? We couldn't make it happen.",1,Negative
"I’d like to know who the manager is here because for a business like Dunkin who a lot of people patronize for breakfast, there was only one person taking AND making orders at 10 am.  That’s shameful.  I left after 15 minutes and went to Chick Fil-A.",1,Negative
"Female employee was preoccupied with packaging HER OWN to go donuts. It's 7p and 90 degrees outside and they didn't have ANY iced coffee because ""day shift didn't make it."" No dark roast either. I guess she was incapable of doing her job and MAKING COFFEE! Also, no changing table in the bathroom in 2019?! Ghetto.",1,Negative
I would give this place a zero if i could.  I don't think i've ever had less than a 5 minute wait.  If you order more than a dozen donuts often times they don't have enough donuts to serve everybody.  The space is dirty and it is in the middle of a number of major business parks.,1,Negative
"I normally am a big fan of ""Dunkin'"" but today was a pretty negative experience. Staff seemed chaotic and didn't now how to reimburse a gift card for an individual. The cashier was unfriendly (though Sonia apologized for the wait). I had my sights on a sausage, egg, and cheese, but the wait was LONG. I settled for something quick...munchkins. I wasn't asked what munchkins I wanted; it was assumed. I just wanted to get out of the store by the end of it. It's the breakfast rush; imo,not they are not a great crew for it. What's management thinking if this is a model for the company?",1,Negative
"Probably partially my fault for purchasing doughnuts after 6 pm.
The two staffers were polite and pleasant but the doughnuts were nowhere near fresh.  At best, they were 8 to 10 hours old and had the texture of cardboard.",1,Negative
"My girlfriend and I recieved wrong orders the first time, our coffees were brought to us with the wrong amount of sugar/creamer, I was charged a whole donut for 1 munchkin, and my food was cold when I received it. Disappointed. Won't be coming here again. P.s. I. Also recieved 5/6 hashbrowns...",1,Negative
"I can’t believe how bad my experience was at this Dunkin’ Dounts. A young man and young lady working behind the counter turning the place to a joke. First, you don’t greet customers by “Waz Up” second, you cannot be on the phone with the speaker on talking loud while there are people waiting to be served. Third, using bad language is offensive to many people. Those two were yelling and fighting over who does what. I suggest the young man to pull up his pants while he is at work, I don’t think people would be interested to see his boxers. They got me so mad that I am willing to talk to them face to face.",1,Negative
This location has a lot of problems and they all can be solved by hiring more people. The wait times are crazy and thats not even counting on the times they just misplace your order due to frantically running around.,1,Negative
"Terrible customer service. You would think the manager would realize that  the morning is busiest time of day. And you should probably have more than three people working.
Will not be returning.",1,Negative
Worst customer service. The manager was so rude and should be fired. Don’t ever talk about a customer behind their backs when they can still hear you. I will never go back to this store and most likely will not go to DD ever again because this manager ruined your reputation.,1,Negative
Don't waste your time if you want an espresso drink. They're too lazy to post a sign where it can be seen other than at the register...,1,Negative
"Double charged me, and tried to give me someone else's order. Don't go to these scheisters. 😡",1,Negative
Don’t order on the mobile app. This site forgets to finish your order as soon as someone walks in the door constantly,1,Negative
Very rude customer service the man working in front was rude besides that I had ordered bacon egg n cheese on toasted bagel told him that I I want my bagel to be toasted and it wasn’t toasted and it was under cooked,1,Negative
Show up at a little after 7am and they have the doors locked! Seriously?,1,Negative
"Frustrating.  The young man on register  messed up the order three times, and never did get it right.  Avoid going on Sat. Morning when he works.",1,Negative
Standing at the register as the young big lady working played on her phone and ignored me. I walked out.,1,Negative

"I go for take out at least 1-3 times a week and I never have a problem with my order This morning there was a Manager Anna S. whom I have never seen in there before decided to micro manage employee TJ raising her voice and talking at him not to him. This young man was so nervous he burnt my bacon, dropped some and also had him talking (answering her questions) over top of my food to the point I had to ask her to stop talking to him and allow him to prepare my food. Very unpleasant and unprofessional experience. I wanted to intervene more because it saddened me how she spoke to him in front of myself and other customers. Dunkin needs to train management on how to train employees because Anna Suarez was rude and belittling to hers. I also informed Anna S that she will be reported",1,Negative
"Long wait times and several incorrect orders per visit.
The staff is friendly enough - when someone points out an incorrect order, they promptly fix the problem. But management needs to do better with training, and increase the number of employees at this location. I've waited over 20 minutes for iced coffee on half a dozen occasions.
Last time I was in, 3 drink orders in a row were made incorrectly.
I love DD, but it's hard to justify coming to this location. Do yourself a favor, and head to the Starbucks a few blocks down the road.",2,Negative
"I stopped coming to this location a while ago and recently started back up, however, I will stop coming to this location once again. I walked up to the counter today and rather than being greeted, the first thing told to me was “if you want to order a hot drink, we’re out”. I was actually there because the mobile order I had placed 15 minutes prior for 2 donuts were not “ready”.  Whenever my mobile order includes donuts, it’s never ready. My drink will be at the pickup area for mobile orders but no donuts. So then I have to wait to speak to get the attention of an employee to grab the rest of my order which defeats the purpose of me placing my order ahead of time. To grab and go and be on my way to work.",2,Negative
Had my coffee remade twice and ended up throwing it away because their service was a disgrace. Don't recommend visiting .,2,Negative
"Used to love dunkin but corp has been getting rid of all the creamers that I like.  No butter pecan which I know was seasonal, no hazelnut, then no salted caramel.  I quit",2,Negative
Staff is great but espresso machine  is down since 2 weeks and dunkin donuts Corp hasn't fixed it despite of complaints from store manager and regional manager. This corporation doesn't seem to take care of its customers. I may go back to Starbucks if this continues. I love the product and staff here but this is unacceptable.,2,Negative
"Was once one of the best locations. Unfortunately that is no longer the case.  I use mobile ordering and the orders are consistently incorrect and the staff are argumentative when you ask for the order to be corrected.  I have wasted a lot of money lately due to wrong drinks and food items.  When I am not in a hurry I may stop by and wait in the slow line, but for my weekday commute it is time to find a new location.",2,Negative
"Took forever cause the girl had no idea what she was doing with the food. Tried to make 3 orders at the same time, didn't know how to adjust the time so ended up making all 3 orders twice. I'll never come back to this store again.",2,Negative
I always have issues at this dunkin...they keep running out of large coffee cups and straws and then just give you a medium as if thats perfectly ok when you pay for a large....always understaffed....the manager needs to learn how to order supplies properly,2,Negative
"I normally love DD regular coffee, unfortunately, after a few visits, I'm pretty sure this location waters there's down. Not great.",2,Negative
OK place....Coffe in the evening is not that great,2,Negative

Fast service and very nice but Holly Molly donut shop do better with the flys people,3,Neutral
"The only gentlemen working in there is very polite, and does his job well. The others are a bit confused and make your coffee incorrect. He has to take over and fix the mistake. Dunkin' should be grateful for a employee like him.",3,Neutral
Lots of cross contamination happens here. Same gloves and parchment paper in toaster for pork products and non pork products. Gloved hand touches food and drawers instead of using non gloved hands for non food items.,3,Negative
Today's drive thru line made me late for work today.  I've never seen it this bad. I pulled into the lot at 9:51 a.m. I work across the street in the Creek View Shopping Center. I didn't clock in until 10:08. I made a wrong decision to stay in that drive-thru line.  Maybe they should do as McDonald's does and just ask the driver to pull aside until their food order gets done.,3,Negative
"My daughter was there in October and after being touted their sale on ground coffee- 3 for $20,- they sold her 3 bags,  2 of which we found to be past the expiration date. Since we live in NJ, their was no way to return for refund or exchange.",3,Negative
"Make sure to check your order, sometimes there are errors. The staff are very nice, friendly, but sometimes when there's lots of orders, mistakes get made. So definitely check your order.",3,Neutral
"The place was very clean. Workers where friendly. Service was very slow. I will definitely go back again, because of the friendly people there. Could use 1 more person to help with customer service.",3,Positive

Ok experience.  Not great and not horrible.  3 stars because I had to point out to the employee that the milk in the case was past their dates by a few weeks.,3,Neutral

Very busy when I went in the morning but the staff was friendly and my coffee came quickly. Doughnuts were pretty good as well.,4,Positive
Donuts were so dry. The sandwich was ok. I had and egg with cheese and bacon croissant. It had extra bacon which I loved. I believe they gave it to me that way because they forgot to make my sandwich after they made my drink. Which was so tasty. I ordered a mixed iced cappuccino. Most locations don't make it right but they did. Thank you. 👍🏼,4,Positive
"Restaurant is in a busy office area so it can get busy in the morning. Food and drinks are good. Never had any problems with my order, but service can be slow. Because of how busy it gets I have left and have witnessed others leaving the store because they take too long. One person left after already paying! Not me. I don't care if I'm going to be late for a meeting but it shouldn't be that way. No drive thru either ☹️.",4,Neutral

"I guess today, you have to be a regular patron to get food. I was denied service yet here is two takeaways sitting on the bar. Literally, minutes after taking this photo the bartender walked past me to get rid of a dish from another customer. Seriously, what is with this bartender's attitude? I walked out before the football game was over and it was a one score game in the 4th quarter.",1,Negative
"Seems like a nice bar if you are looking for drinks but the food was HORRIBLE. Stopped in here for dinner because we were starving and stuck in traffic and were excited for some good hot food. We ordered a burger and fries and a breakfast platter (sausage, eggs, biscuits and gravy) and were immediately disappointed by what we were brought.
The burger was cooked well done (we had ordered medium rare) and seemed like it had been sitting out for a while as it was barely warm. The bun was cold like it had been in the fridge and the cheese wasn’t even melted. This was the burger that was listed as “hot” and “spicy” but there was no seasoning or flavor whatsoever. The fries were ok but were not seasoned at all, not even salt.
The breakfast platter was also nothing to write home about. I ordered my eggs “over medium” and they came out with runny whites. The portion was very small and again nothing was seasoned and it had no flavor whatsoever. It was like eating mushy wet cardboard.
We are only because we had been waiting for what felt like 40 minutes for our food but we left completely unsatisfied. Once drove away, we saw that Elmers was right ahead of us and we were both thoroughly annoyed that we had wasted our money at “Bill’s Steak House Lounge” when we could have enjoyed a meal with at least twice the quality at the same price at Elmers. We won’t be making that mistake again. If you do choose to eat here, we hope your experience is better than ours was.",1,Negative
"Bad service.  When we got there the server was outside smoking. Came in took our orders and didn't wash her hands. Didn't bring us a knife. Had to hunt her down for one.  The food was horrible. I ordered the pepper steak.  It was really thin and tough.  The cheapest cut of meat.  I had one bite.  Could not even chew and swallow it.  The frozen veggies on the plate came out cold.  The salad had a lot of old pieces of lettuce.  It was drowning in the dressing. I didn't finish my meal.  I didn't even want to finish my beer.  Had to get out of there. When we explained about the food, they still charged us full price. Don't waste your money there.",1,Negative
"I am looking for my wives service animal lucky. The bartender helped push my wives service animal into a truck. My wife was ruffied at glasdhouse bar and was incohearant. She was harassed all day about her service animal at glasdhouse and had only 2 shots over 12 hours of being there. She bought lunch and left glasshouse at 8pm. She reached the cemetary and remembers nothing after that. The bartender at bills has now told her she isnt allowed back. This after my wife asking to
manyvquestions. We have had lucky since he was a baby. He is pitt sharpei and terrier. Hevis white with brown spots

Would not suggest to anyone. Baked potatoe under cooked. Steaks over seasoned and thin for a 6oz sirloin. Could barely eat the steak. Boyfriend took one bite of his ribeye which was also thin cut was so tough he couldn't eat it.,1,Negative
"If the owner only cared to read these reviews.

November 1, 2016.  Waited japproximately 15 minutes to try and order dinner. I eventually had to go to the bar to order dinner.  It appeared socializing was the top priority of this bartender/waitress. To give hugs that last more than a minute and a half while making iContact .",1,Negative
"One of the worst experience dining in USA. The service was smth beyond normal - we were waiting for beer 10 minutes. The side salads were served within 20 minutes. The steaks... nothing. Nothing good can be mentioned. My husband meat-lover did not wanted to finish it. Vegetables served were like smth plastic with no taste. It took 1,5 hour to have ordinary tasteless dinner.

"The only thing good here is the cold beer and the slots. I had the Bacon wrapped filet mignon, steak was under cooked and the bacon was cold. I asked for medium rare and it was almost rare. But on the bright side I won two hundred bucks on the slots. 👎🏼 …",2,Negative
"I ate at Bill's a couple times several years ago & was very pleased with a good quality steak at a reasonable price. Sadly, it isn't the way it used to be. Tonight's supper cost 30% more that it used to and the quality was terrible. My NY strip was full of gristle and I seriously doubt that it even came close to the advertised 12 oz. It was both smaller and much thinner than when I made the same order on previous visits. On top of that, the veg was cooked to mush and the baked potato must have been keeping warm in the oven ever since lunch time.

I know times are hard for restaurants, but the owner has gone too far in trying to squeeze out the last dime of profit. I was there at around 5PM and the bar was full of drinkers, so there's no doubt they're making money...liquor is the source of most of the profits in a sports bar/restaurant.

On the good side, the staff was friendly and attentive. None-the-less, I don't think I'll be going back there.",2,Negative
"French fries are good. Roast ok, steak and cheese sticks🤮🤮🤮",2,Negative
Got take out fish-and-chips  The fish was so hard you could hardly eat it it was like they had stuck it back in the microwave to reheat it says it is supposed to come with a coldslaw and toast did not have any of that in there not a very good place to go..,2,Negative
"Food was decent.  Service was awful.  Not because if covid.  You could at least check back to see if we want another beer? Acknowledge that we asked for one? Socialize less, check in with other customers.",2,Negative
"The ambiance of this place is next to non existent.  As is the rat infested trim track adjacent, cesspit that is park rose 🌹  Which I'm sure must be an ironic term because because there is neither aros either a rose nor a park to be found in park rose …",2,Negative
"The best thing about this place was leaving. We waited for near an hour for our food with a waitress running around without a clue that customers needed service. We happened to be seated by the kitchen so sadly we could see how long food sat in the window, darn near 10 minutes in some cases. Our food came after we saw it get put into the service window. However, my wife's 'halibut' dinner? Well I can hardly say anything good about it, for 13 bucks, you got 4 small pieces of fish, I personally think it was cod and not a nice piece of meaty halibut as stated. The garlic bread was so incredibly salty, it was not edible. We were never asked once as our waitress wizzed by several times, how are food was, did we need a refill on our drinks, etc... I sucked on ice cubes and then took my wife's drink. My pork sliders tasted as if they had been sitting all day long, the chicken cordon blue bites were mostly chicken not horrible, but a small bit of ham with maybe if you were lucky some cheese. We left unhappy after having to flag her down for a box, not sure why I even brought it home except it was a lot of money to spend for the meal. Oh and the salad is just plain ole salad out of a bag, no added anything, no tomatoes, nothing. As I said the best part was getting the heck out. Would not recommend unless you are there to play pool get enough drinks in you that anything at that point would taste good. Maybe it was an off night? But I doubt it, there was no bell that even let her know food was up, but then again? there was only a handful of us in there.... Would not return or recommend.",2,Negative
"Poor service, the bartender took care of everybody in the bar, even those that weren't asking for anything. then decided to come get to me",2,Negative
Crusty little spot for steak. As a lounge? Totally cool dive bar. But i was on the way to the airport and I was looking for a local steak house and it didnt hit the spot. But again as a lunge/bar thumbs up.,2,Neutral
"Worst Filet EVER. I travel for work a lot, so I am all over. I try to get a good steak whenever I am on the road, this place looked promising, boy was I wrong. Ordered the Bacon Wrapped 10oz. Filet medium, salad came first, it was fine, steak came out a few minutes later, looked ok, smelled ok, took a bite, tasted off, not sure if it was freezer burnt or just bad meat, took one more bite, from the middle, tasted worse, did not even finish chewing, waitress asked if something was wrong, I told her it tasted like it was bad meat.... she said they pride themselves on their filets. I don't see how.... that was the worst steak I ever tried to eat.... I have had mucg better food at Waffle house. I will not be going back there whenever I am in Portland again.",2,Negative
"Not best, expensive and the people working wernt friendliest,, and the patrons were all judgie and gave an evil look when i walked in cuz i  not from here",2,Negative
"I'm sure of one thing. The person working when I visited Bill's didn't want to work. I'm over 50 and when someone refuses to serve me because the first thing out of their mouth is ""I need to see your ID."" that tells me they'd rather be a cop than serve food.",2,Negative

The service was great! It's got a homey feel in such a big city. Their poker machines were not hitting though spent a lot of money in a short amount of time. The food's good and the service is even better. So if video poker isn't your thing I would recommend it.,3,Positive

We order door Dash… Last night. It was about 8 o’clock right before they were going to close I ordered my husband the filet mignon medium rare and I ordered me a New York steak medium rare. The bill was close to $80 for two dishes. We didn’t mind I was really craving steak when he got was completely delicious what I got was a gray piece of shoe leather.  My steak was a lot thinner than his and they put it in a plastic container to be delivered. That is a steam box it basically cook my steak to pretty much well done and I tossed most of it out. I really wish these places would stop using plastic containers to deliver food. I don’t know if I will try it again it was kind of a disappointment for that kind of money I could’ve went to Ruth’s Chris,3,Negative
"My fiancé and I were really wanting to have a decent steak dinner and this place did not disappoint.  The 6oz  top sirloin was grilled really nicely and the baked potato with a side of steamed veggies.  The meal was great, the ambiance however, left a lot to be desired.  This place is great but it is more of a bar than it is a restaurant.  For a good and inexpensive steak dinner, this is the place but it isn't really date night material.",3,Positive
"Waitress,  Lisa, was awesome. She was all alone but we still got excellent service.   The food was it but not as good as it used to be.  Used to go there often but don't live or work near there anymore.  Probably won't make the effort again.  I miss their awesome food.",3,Neutral
"It is what it is. French Onion soup was disappointing, but I'm not sure why I was expecting anything more than a decent broth and lots of onions. I'm willing to bet the cheese came out of a shaker. Steak was meaty, a little overcooked for my taste.
Come on, it's an old school steak house that has seen better days, but it always delivers meaty flavor and a decent cheap steak. There's just some days where it's enough.",3,Negative
Food was just okay. Waitress didn't really even get kinda happy towards me till the tipping part of her shift.  Kinda disappointed but maybe it was just an off day.,3,Negative
"Disappointing! For a steak house, Bill's isn't high on our list anymore. The last 2 times we've had the top sirloin, we had to send it back for being very tough. The server was great and saved our evening, thankfully. My husband really hates having to send food back!",3,Negative
"I will say this place has unbeatable prices for steaks. Half the cost of any other steak house. The service is OK, they have low staff so you will be waiting for you drinks and food. Steaks are OK, but you will leave full I promise.",3,Neutral

Non enthusiastic employee. Boring atmosphere. Great for someone who wants to hide away and blow their check on poker.,3,Negative
"Mediocre across the board. The steak is a little dry and I could make a better one at home on my bbq. The only reason to come here is if you are in the area and you are hungry. Other than that, there are plenty of better steak houses.",3,Neutral

"Friendly local bar and grill. Good prices and good food. The staff was AMAZING. The one woman we saw seemed to be the only one waiting on people and it was easily 5-6 tables of people AND the bar she was holding down. Even still she was so friendly, attentive, and didn't get a thing wrong. She commented she had ""real good cooks tonight"" and they didn't disappoint!",4,Positive
"We have driven by this gem countless times since we moved to pdx 12 years ago and never gave it a second look. A friend recommended their burger so the hubs and I stopped in for dinner.  Great service, super reasonable prices, clean, large portions. I grew up in Idaho and this place reminds me of many bar&grill growing up- they serve all the basics like steak bites and tots and sides of ranch and huge burgers.

They are not kid friendly- there are slots at the back of the dining area so no minors are allowed.

Dont judge a book by its cover! This place is worth a stop in!",4,Positive
"This landmark in a part of town that has seen better days still has much of it appeal that is gone from its surrounding neighborhood.  The food still surprisingly average as it always was. This is a good thing considering quality has declined across the board at most places. The staff, meaning the bartender,if you get there after the dinner crowd, was attentive,  friendly and kept busy between the regulars at the bar, the newcomers,  meaning myself and my better hal6, the handful of video poker players loosing money. I applaud her for her for the valiant job.  But is the small restaurant atmosphere I come for and was happy to see it still exists. No big chain dishes, menus or patrons here, just the good old folks you would expect from a place like Bill's Steakhouse. I recommend you give it a try and I think you will be surprisingly satisfied with what you find",4,Positive
"I was craving steak and headed to the airport and this happened to be on the way. The waitress/bar tender was nice but couldn't help make any sort of meal recommendations on account of how hung over and nautious she was feeling (her words not mine). The place is definitely more of a longue/ bar than a steak house and I had second guessed my decision to eat there until I tried their soup (it was good). Overall the food was good, a bit cold and the place seemed like a good place to hang out.",4,Positive
"I stopped in this place get out of the rain warm up with a drink. I used to come here when I lived nearby with my ex boyfriend play video poker drink some cocktails, It was just the same as it was back then which was perfect for the night I was having. It's not gonna be a poppin & hopping pick up joint. Or on over crowded super loud place you can't hear it yourself think.  But it's gonna be warm, It's gonna have some good people behind the bar, that actually do know how to make a drink.
You'll almost always find somebody in there that have some stories to tell.
And if you lose at video poker, maybe some of the stories you heard will help ya out later on down the road in your own life, and that's worth more than any amount you can put into a machine. Thats all i have to say, except this: Be 💯, respect your elders, Use the back door, not the front.",4,Positive

"Went today, (Thursday) and seen they had filet on special. So I ordered one. I'm a filet kinda girl, so take that into consideration... bartender was great. Day shift. Potato was cooked perfectly,  steak was cooked perfectly, but the quality made the steak a little bit tuff, considering I worked in a steakhouse for many years, but for the price I paid...(19.99) I'm going to have to say I will go back for another Thursday special,  and veggies were on point! Ordered my food to go, and played on those machines in the back. Lost 60 in 15 minutes. Not their fault I'm sure, but other that that I would give them 5 stars. They also have a newly felted pool table for those that like to increase there skills. 12-9-21",4,Positive

Wow! I just discovered their split pea soup. Thick and delicious!",4,Positive
"Hadn't been there in 5 yrs  or more.outside still looks a little shabby but they remodeled the inside very clean,and it has a rustic (nice cabin in the woods)feel to it.We went on a fri eve.and though I dont recall the bartenders name I have to say I was impressed she had 6/8 people at the bar and including us probably the same amount sitting at tables  give or take a person or two.And she was on it! She made a good drink,took our food order,was personable,and our food was served in good time. We ordered burgers and they were quite yummy,we got tots instead of fries and they were perfect too crispy brown not greasy.5/6 tra ago I had gone there with a friend and got steak dinner it wasnt horriable it just wasnt anything you write home about.i think that their turning things around and I intend to go back soon and maybe brave a steak.if it's as good as the burger I think I'll start going there reg.",4,Positive

"Bills Steakhouse could be considered an icon in the Park Rose area even if it is in name only these days.
But I'm comparing to a whole different time which is unfair.
My memories are from back when it was the best bang for your buck when hungry for a nice chunk of beef. They stayed open late and were quite popular with the after the bars closed crowd.
But that was then. My most recent experience was only disappointing because it's not really a steakhouse so the menu is different.
Whereas the bar and restaurant used to be separate they have knocked the wall out and it appears that the bar is the primary business.
That being said, I found the service adequate and the prices reasonable.
The highlight of my recent visits Is that I have walked out with more money than I came in with by at least a hundred bucks. Thanks to the video gambling.",5,Positive

Stayed at the Best Western at 10th of a mile down the road it was pleasantly surprised with this little lounge. Shaleen was the bartender and I sat at the bar to have country fried steak and mashed potatoes. I was questioning if it was a good idea to get a $12 meal when most everything else on the menu was several dollars more. It was a very good value and tasted great. Shaleen was the cherry on top with her positive attitude and hospitality.,5,Positive
"We stopped in after missing an appointment. The food was quite good and very reasonably priced. When we went to pay our GIFT CARD wouldn't run, before we could pull out a card to pay, one of the bar patrons called the bartender over and paid for our dinner! I have no idea who he was. But I'd like to thank him again, his generosity was a bright spot in a very rainy day. THANK YOU kind stranger!",5,Positive
