"The steaks range from 60 dollars to 130 dollars. This is a high price for a steak but well worth it, if the steak is prepared how you want it. When you are paying that much for a steak and it seems like they cannot prepare it how you like. I'm simple I like medium. I have been here 5 times in last 3 months, the bourbon is the only thing bringing me back. The wait staff is awesome, the pork belly is awesome, but for some reason a chop house needs to learn how to cook a steak. At the end of the day every time i had a issue with the steak they did make it right , but still because they have messed up a steak 3 out of 5 times I give them a 1 star and more then likely will find another bourbon spot. Cheers",1,Neutral
"Worst, most overpriced steak I’ve ever had! Even after telling the waiter it was over cooked and him agreeing, nothing was done. I’d rather have Chipotles steak than 801’s.",1,Negative
I would give this zero stars if I could. The blonde female manager was straight up rude. My group had a reservation and some of the people in our group were late. I let the hostess at the front (also very condescending) know and she said that was fine and she still seated us. Then out of now where the manager came up and told us that the rest of our group had five minutes to get here otherwise the wouldn’t be seated. If they had let us know this when we got here we wouldn’t have sat down. We were celebrating a birthday and this ruined it. We will never be coming back here again because of that woman.,1,Negative

I wanted to love Chophouse. I went here for my birthday with family. I specifically picked this place because their claim “best prime rib in town.” Myself and another gal got the prime rib. It was a beautiful piece of meat, cooked perfectly, but with ZERO flavor. I have never had a flavorless prime rib. I assure you I could taste other dishes, and we both shared with other table mates who agreed. It’s like a complete step was missed in seasoning the meat. I watched in horror as someone put salt and pepper on the prime rib to give it flavor. I have never had such a flavorless piece of meat in my life. Our other guests got the ribeye and pork chop which they said were great. Drink service was slow the entire night, even though we were right next to the bar. We could see other servers waiting some time for their drinks, but didn’t run ours to our table 6ft away. Finally we flagged one of them down, because our server brought the check, but not our last drink (which we were already charged for).",2,Negative
"
Their wagu steak was just a regular ribeye. I was expecting an extraordinary mouthwatering steak but it was just “decent”. For $90 I think it should have been much better. Also, there are no sides that come with that. You have to order them separately. The service was good but the food is not worth it.",2,Neutral
"
Highly disappointed in both the service and the food. Arrived on time for our reservations, promptly seated but took 20 minutes to be greeted by any staff and that included getting water. Server forgot to bring out appetizers, ordered the off menu steak server presented which was HUGE but what I received was a charred ribeye that was about 1/3 of what was presented and over cooked. I told the server this is not what I ordered he disagreed. Asparagus was missing the hollandaise sauce, requested it but never received it, ordered the seasonal morel mushrooms buyer be aware $30 for 6 dry mushrooms. Ordered bottle service and we had the pleasure of refilling our own drinks. During our dinner someone came in off the street walked in asked us for money. Cocktails were weak and when they forgot the pineapple juice in a drink we asked for it and we were charged extra. Mind you the restaurant was empty so there was no reason for such terrible service. Server had very little personality but did chuckle and said yeah not my best performance. Gave us our $900 bill not offering to split it, did not thank us for coming in and did not invite us back. I followed up with restaurant on our experience and they never acknowledged or responded.",2,Negative
"
Daughter took me here for my birthday. Started out great. The cocktail was good and sourdough bread was yummy. Then we put our order in and told our server there was a toddler and infant at home that we needed to get home to. Our salads were supposed to be speedy but took close to 20 minutes. Our food took another 45 minutes and entres were cool and overcooked. The crab cake and asparagus were amazing. The manager did comp our meal so we will give them another chance.",2,Neutral
"
It was ok, not the best food. The spinach was raw, not cooked all the way. The lobster mac and cheese was absolutely disgusting we didn't finish it. The noodles were rubbery, the lobster was completely over cooked. Tasted horrible. The service however, outstanding. Unfortunately, the bad food outshined the service.",2,Negative

It's like outback steakhouse, but much more over priced.

I tried a bite of steak from everyone at my table and had the dry aged new york strip myself, everything just tasted bland. It was decent but definietly not $100+/steak good.  Our table was in the middle of the dining room and it had to be atleast 110 degrees where we were sitting. Everyone at the table had to take their sweaters off and go outside at least once during the meal just to cool down a bit.",3,Negative
"
The attention from the servers and the steaks themselves were outstanding.  But the rest of the dishes were not up to par for a steakhouse at this level.  The braised pork belly appetizer was a little under done.  Safe to eat, but not as savory as it could have been.  Rather gummy and bland.  The wedge salad was a from a small, sad head of lettuce.  The salad, the plate, and the fork was all room-temperature and not chilled as they should have been.  Brussel sprouts were very good.  Asparagus, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes were average.  It certainly wasn't a bad experience.  But at this price point, it wasn't what it should have been.",3,Neutral
"
I've been here multiple times and really enjoyed it but my most recent visit left a bad taste in my mouth and I don't know the next time I'll be back. The server was somehow both rushing us but also seemed to take forever on anything- I really don't mind things taking a while especially in a fine dining restaurant but being rushed simultaneously was a little stressful.

The Caesar salad was disappointing- the lettuce was nearly wilted and was lacking dressing.

The weirdest part was that I only got soda water to drink and was not only charged for it, but charged for refills as well? I'm not cheap but I've never been charged for soda water before and especially not refills...

Overall it was a bit of a disappointing experience but the company was wonderful and for that it was worth it.",3,Neutral

I came here on Valentine’s Day. Our reservation was at 9:15, we were seated around 30 minutes later. The restaurant was busy, we had to either get a drink from the bar or stand in front until we were called. We sat next to the window and were able to smell people smoking outside of the restaurant. It was gross. When we were brought back, we ordered a shrimp appetizer that was great, and ordered salmon and king crab legs for entrees. The cost of the crab legs would have made me think that they take the meat out of the shell at the table side, but they didn’t. We ordered garlic mashed potatoes as a side. It was dark, and tasted like it had been in the warmer all day and was overcooked, almost burnt. We were also celebrating my birthday so they gave us a free dessert. We ordered the mango sherbet which was a plus. For the cost of this restaurant, there is a lot of room for improvement. Our food was okay, the smell of cigarettes almost  made me lose my appetite. Overall, not as great as the previous reviews had mentioned.",3,Negative
"
Fantastic atmosphere and top notch service. Very large restaurant but it did not feel like it. We were seated in a 2 person booth near the bar which was fantastic. Our apps, mains, and drinks were all cooked/prepared to perfection, but there was one glaring issue in our minds. The level of salt used on the steaks and sides was out of control and overpowering. It was to the point where we left somewhat disappointed, especially after the experience in general was fantastic. If this place wants to compete with Capital Grille and the like at their price point, they will need to get this under control. Everything would have been 5 stars if they would remove the absurd amount of salt from everything. Hope to hear they figure this out soon and we will be back!",3,Neutral

Old fashioned steakhouse done right.  The wedge salad was excellent, with the right amount of chunky bacon and just the right amount of blue cheese on the lettuce and the tomatoes were exceptional.

The rib eye medium was the right temperature with a nice crust and well seasoned.   The side of French fries could easily serve two.

The classic vodka martini slightly dirty with blue cheese olives was excellent - the cheese in the olives was very unique and really good.

Sat at the bar and noticed much more prompt and attentive service at the tables.   At the tables, they parade the steaks and explain the specials etc which you don't get at the bar, understandably.   Would visit again when in town.",4,Positive
"
Service was really good, waiter, host and other staff walking around were all very nice and attentive. Food was pretty good but not the best I've had from the other steak spots downtown and the sides were kind of small. Still a really nice dinner. I also like the meat cart they brought around so you see all the meats before ordering. We ordered the 12oz filet mignon with truffle butter, 24oz Delmontico with bone marrow butter (very herby) , scalloped potatoes, cream spinach and the lemon bar dessert. The filet mignon and scalloped potatoes were delicious.",4,Positive

I have been a guest at the 801 for years and was so happy to see it came to Minneapolis.   I wasn't disappointed t all.  The staff was spot on and so attentive.

It was my sister's birthday and the restaurant did a great job with decorating the table, a signed menu, and a free dessert. The appetizers, down home shrimp and crab cake, were delicious. Our favorite was the down home shrimp. Our entrees, the New York strip with truffle butter and apple pork chops, were good but overall very salty. Our side of French fries potatoes was a large plateful and great quality. The dinner ended with a delicious creme brulee dessert. Overall, a fantastic meal, but the meat was somewhat disappointing.",4,Positive
"
Well actually it's more like a 4.6! Service was excellent, Ny Strip steak and Lobster top notch, the shrimp appetizer with the Guinness brown sugar ""gravy"" and mashed potatoes was unique and excellent. The Asparagus was kind of sugary sweet and a tender to the point of being overcooked. They are an excellent addition to the downtown steakhouse scene.",4,Positive
"
A great new addition to Nicollet Mall! Great food, excellent service and a great elegant atmosphere. Lots of great choices on the menu. The only down side is their dessert menu which seems to be lack luster and does not match the rest of the menu.

Besides that, you can't go wrong by dining here. Perfect place for business meeting, date night or a get together with friends.",4,Positive

Great steak!
I came for dinner to have ribeye steak and some dessert.
The hostesses were very pleasant and polite.
My server was very professional - I received just the right amount of attention without being bothered, but also felt cared for and that I don't wait for a long time to ask questions or get my table cleared from dirty dishes (my biggest pet peeve in restaurants).
The steak was just perfection - I mean, I do expect perfect steak at the steak house, where I pay for it >$80, but still. I really enjoyed it, and it didn't disappoint.
I wasn't planning on getting the dessert, but Creme Brulee sounded amazing, and it was heavenly :)
The decor of the restaurant was a bit too formal for my taste but very pleasing, with the art wall bringing the element of fun and interest.",5,Positive
"
Came here to celebrate a milestone birthday dinner and it was more than perfect! I arrived a lot earlier than my reservation but was still able to get seated right away. The table was decorated for this special occasion.

Ordered the ribeye and the prime rib and I would definitely go back for more prime rib! It was delicious and the best I’ve had compared to other places.

For dessert we go to choose from the dessert list as a complimentary birthday dessert. The sugar coat on top for the crème brûlée was too thick in my opinion, but it was still very good.

Our server was great and funny but it took 30+ mins after seating to order. He did push out a cart full of their cuts so you can see.",5,Positive
"
The level of detail the waiter extended to describe each cut of meat was impeccable, the service was exemplary for our party (and friend celebrating his birthday), and the menu options as well as the preparation is a step above the closest (aka across the street) competitor. The cuts of delmonico, prime rib, and mishima were breath taking. Definitely will return.",5,Positive

My absolute favorite place to eat downtown. Went to the one in Des Moines Iowa years ago and was so happy when they open one in Minneapolis I feel years back. Everything is top of the line.

So we got into town and decided to come and check 801 out. Well I have to tell you that my wife and I travel around the country 8 months out of the year and we always try at least two of the top steak houses while we are in town. With that said this place is very good. From the moment we walked in the hostess was very welcoming and got us right to our table and at the table they had confetti on the table for my wife’s birthday. What a nice surprise. Our server was excellent and gave use the a-z tour of the menu and the history of the restaurant. The cuts of meat were amazing. I had the double bone in pork chop that was cooked to perfection. My wife had the 5 oz filet that was so tender and juicy. We did half portions of the mashed potatoes and the cream corn that we could have eaten way more it was so delicious. For dessert they brought her out a little baked Alaskan. If you are ever in town please check this place out you will be happy that you did. We will be going back this coming weekend to try some other stuff",5,Positive
"
I have been here for almost a week and have tried other steakhouses in the area and this is by far THE BEST steak I have had here! I ordered the ribeye and it was very juicy and had amazing flavor! If you are looking for the best steak, you must come here. I’m from Texas where we have some of the best steaks in town and this place surpassed that!",5,Positive
"
This was hands down the best meal and experience we have had in a very long time.  Our food was exceptional in very way.. texture, flavor, temperature and presentation.  Chef Lawrence is a culinary master and was kind enough to to come to our table and spend time with us.  We felt so special.

Our waiter Patrick made my husband’s birthday one to remember… The ambiance was one of  a warm and welcoming environment of class and sophistication. Patrick introduced each premium cuts of meats; describing what each of them have to offer.  Our mouths were watering in expectation of our meals.  It DID NOT DISAPPOINT.  The steak and lobster melted in mouths and had such flavor.

I don’t want to leave too long a review; but I don’t have enough words to thank them for a wonderful birthday of such service and food.

We will be back as often as we can.",5,Positive

My husband and I stumbled across the 801 Chophouse about a year ago, during a wedding weekend for friends.  This is now our entire family's favorite restaurant, in MN, hands down.

We stopped by the former Barnes and Noble location for Happy Hour and to see what was going on in here. The food and service are as close to perfect as exists in Minneapolis. The Oysters Rockefeller are extraordinary. They serve very fresh (large) poached bluepoint oysters with a considerably better than average Rockefeller treatment (bacon, cheese, and spinach) with fresh Hollandaise. Superb - they rank among the best we’ve ever had anywhere. Their drinks were made extremely well (try the house martini) and our waiter was charming, accommodating, and informative. We also enjoyed our very fresh lobster tail, shrimp cocktail, and lobster Mac and cheese.  We loved the deserts; which were Baked Alaska and Creme Brûlée.

This is a cavernous space with great meeting rooms. I can imagine hosting wonderful client dinners from a dozen to fifty people in these cool, well appointed rooms, complete with large screen monitors.

My only minor criticism is that Happy Hour prices are honored only while sitting at the bar.  Since we wanted to talk within our group of five, we requested a table and enjoyed our time. This may have only cost us a couple of dollars per drink, but given there were many empty tables available, it seemed slightly petty. Good experience, we’ll be back! Maybe we’ll sit at the damn bar.",5,Positive

I took my fiancé here for his birthday dinner and from start to finish this was an excellent experience. We were running about 30 minutes late of our reservation because our gps was giving us the run around but we were still very much welcomed when we arrived.

I mean it is all so thoughtful and nice.The restaurant is beautiful! The staff very warm and friendly.

I am not authority in steakhouses, I will admit. That being said, this was the best experience I've ever had at a steakhouse.

The booths are comfortable and private, lighting perfect, and atmosphere polite, yet friendly.  Our waiter was very attentive and professional.  We were delighted with his knowledge of different cuts of meats, and explanation of the aging process.
And the food!!!  I am a stickler for good manners, but I must say: Manny's fans... there a new place in town and wow! It's a no-brainer, head to the Chophouse.  Oh, and the onion rings, which literally melt in your mouth, are a fabulous appetizer.  My sister and I enjoyed the Fillet Mignon and Prime, which arrived hot and perfect!
This will no doubt become our favorite for anniversaries and other special dates. Thank you 801!!",5,Positive

Never been. Surprisingly good ribeye, mushrooms, and green beans, though I make better roasted brussel sprouts. Service was phenomenal, friendly, and knowledgeable. Highly recommend, though it's obviously a bit spendy.",5,Positive

We celebrated our anniversary at 801 Chophouse.

From the moment we walked in the front door, we were met with a warm and welcoming experience. Everyone was genuinely kind and knowledgeable. Our waiter Michael was attentive and knowledgeable about the specials, meat types, and overall menu.

They decorated our table to commemorate our anniversary and the staff seemed genuinely happy for us, creating a familial atmosphere. Such a nice touch.

The food, cocktails, and wine were fantastic. I would definitely recommend the Tempranillo to accompany the Delmonico.

We will definitely be returning.",5,Positive

My Dad and I ate here while attending a convention in downtown Minniapolis. Both the food and service were excellent.  The general manager, Dannie, and our server, Baily, made sure we were taken care of. I cannot say enough good things about this establishment. I highly recommend.",5,Positive

We visited 801 Chophouse with our friends for  couples night out. We had a great experience from beginning to end. Jorge our server was amazing! He was very friendly and professional, knowledgeable of the menu and gave us fantastic recommendations, including the delicious cocktails👍.
We really enjoyed the service and the meal.",5,Positive

801 is the absolute best steakhouse we've been to. Everything was perfect and delicious. The grand mariner souffle dessert is highly recommended!!",5,Positive
"
After a Business Meeting Downtown, we stumbled into 801 Chophouse by chance after multiple places were still closed. Immediately upon walking in, we were greeted with the utmost warmness and respect from Dani, the General Manager. Being our first time visiting, we were given the grand tour, and GRAND this restaurant is! Although much of the decor is catered to our local love of Minneapolis, it also has a very swanky New York steakhouse vibe. The Craft Cocktails were creative & fresh, and the Crabcakes were some of the best we’ve ever had. Known for their meat selection, we can’t wait to come back for more!

Ask for Jorge as your Server 😉 phenomenal!

In a world where service seems to be lost, and moods are admittedly down, this surprise visit to 801 Chophouse completely surpasses anything we’ve experienced this year! Highly recommend you visit 🤗

Never have we ever been to such a fancy place. Kinda felt out of our element but soon felt at home. Thank you for educating us some and being so welcoming.

Manny’s has held the title on the king of upscale steak restaurants in the city.  I’ve gone there faithfully for years.  I’ll now go to 801 chophouse and faithfully.   The rib eye I had the other night was nothing short of amazing.   It melted in my mouth.   We have several top notch restaurants in the city, this may well be the best.   I’ve traveled all over the world and taken many a client out for dinner to a large variety of restaurants, this may be the best one I’ve went to.  Proud to have this restaurant in my city.  Service and staff are incredible and the atmosphere is simply on another level.  I’ll be coming back!!!",5,Positive

I've gone there 3x (while I was doing laundry) And Everytime I go the employees are so rude. The only reason I still go back is because it's cheaper than the other places. And has air conditioning.

Just arrived home from the Story and White Road Burger King and found my order in error! I ordered 4 #1 whopper meals and was missing one entire order. Spent $57.00 and found one of those meals missing with my mother not getting a meal, we all had to pass out some of ours to make food for her?! Lots of customers and only one Hispano woman tending the window. Saw a manager on the floor, but did not help with the congestion of customers. NEVER going back and this wasn’t the first time I’ve had this mistake on previous orders.",1,Negative

I ordered (2) 4 for 4 breakfast croissant egg sandwiches. I understand that asking for specifications and substitution always puts me at risk of disappointment but as a Muslim family it can rarely be avoided. So I asked that the meat be  substituted for egg. I got 4 sandwiches that smelled like sausage and had specs of brown on the egg and bread, knowing you don't pepper your eggs... It shouldn't be such a hassle to be accommodated at a place that claims you can have it your way.",1,Negative
"
Asked for 2 things. Very simple. One medium meal, one small. They gave me 2 small drinks. I told them and they said it is a medium. I held up both and then the girl at the window said ""oh yeah, I only charged you for a small meal."" I showed her receipt because she didn't. She said there wasn't any medium cups ... basically she charged me and gave me something different. Nothing was fixed. Just this location sucks. Not the first time its happened( we've been coming here for years)  but I'll make sure it's the last. Won't be coming here anymore.",1,Negative

Drive thru is horrible.  Reliability of their card scanner is bad.

My experience:  queued up for drive thru, got to mic and saw sign on mic that said ""not accepting cards, cash only"", I asked why.  Employee said card machine was down.   I had waiting in queue to see sign and I was forced to wait thru the line without making an order (since I carry no cash).

Service was worst than poor. The server at the counter, looking like a tall, slim college kid, just didn't want to be there. He was extremely slow, did not care about serving his Customers in a timely manner. To get a simple croissant sandwich, hash browns, and coffee took over 30 minutes. Prepared Food from the cooks were stacked up in the Ready area waiting for him to bag them and distribute, but he was just la-di-da'ing. When my order was finally ready, he forgot the coffee. Told him and he said didn't I get it already? No. Well, it would take another three minutes to brew. What a useless $@&#. I was not the only person complaining.  Three others complained about their orders taking forever also.",1,Negative

Everytime we come(we dont come very often) the person taking our order is always friendly but as soon as we get to the cashier(drive thru) he is soooo rude !!! He talks like a robot , doesnt smile and if we ask for extra ketchup or sauce he just gives us a death stare says nothing and hands us one and he doesnt even have a hello or have a good day/night, the only words he says is the price and thats it. Literally. And they get our food orders wrong and food is for some reason cold:/",1,Negative

I've been here at least five times and every single time they say their shake machine is out of order... All Burger king's in general seem to have the same ""out of order"" machines and it's annoying.

Burger King should just remove shakes altogether if they continuously refuse it to people.",1,Negative

Burger King sends me coupons in the mail. Their food is pretty good for fast food. It's more healthy than Mickey Ds in my opinion.

I like coupon 6618. 2 Whopper Jrs. 2 fries for 3.99. I can never finish the fries and I share one hamburger with my dog.

Its not an everyday meal but it does work to fill the hump.

I love it at Burger king, the food tastes so good, the employees greeting is excellent, 2 special women took care of us. One looked 40's years old, I think she's a shift leader or maybe manager, I was on the line waiting for somebody to take my order, she came close to me and she smiled and said, I will be right with you in just a moment. My breakfast was so yummy....thank you Burger King!

It's... A Burger King. We usually go through the drive-through and there are absolutely no surprises--which I've found is a real plus in a fast food place. They get our order right, they get the price right, they give us exactly what we ordered, and if we ask for anything unusual, they take care of it with good grace. Boring is perfect when what you want is food units. (Good job, folks! Seriously. Would be surprised how often fast food places fail at executing. 😀)",5,Positive

I RECOMEND  to order online  (you will save lots of time )
The portions are big... incredible test!
I absolutely  love it will order again",5,Positive
Have been here twice. The service is really erratic. Servers don‚Äôt know the recipes on their menu and they served me a falafel pita that looked like it was designed by Jackson Pollack.  Don‚Äôt know why the server thought this much sauce was ok.,2,Negative
"Delicious food at an amazing price. Shout out to my server Mohammed and Vanvel (I believe they are also managers here) who were super attentive to my order and provided amazing portions. In the past I believe the portions were a lot smaller, but has grown generously as of the last couple of months. Great service to be honest, will recommend and come back.",5,Positive

"Jeremiah is the freakin man. Called in @ 10min to close, person who answered phone said no way, then the phone was passed to Jeremiah who was kind, understanding, and said he would help me out. Made it there just at 9 as they were closing, to a fully pimped-out bowl made by him. That's true customer service, y'all!

Don't ever even bother with the new sweetgreen down the block @ Duffield, this is the one and only true true salad spot of dtbk!!",5,Positive
This location does not prepare the food well. I have been here a few times and have also ordered take out from this location. I love CAVA but this location is not it. The food always taste like it‚Äôs a day old or it‚Äôs very cold. Not to mention the food station always looks super sloppy.,1,Negative
BRANDON assisted me & his customer service is nothing to complain about! Assisted me with patience & deff made my day‚Ä¶ he BLESSED it !,5,Positive

Good is Delicious.. Everything is fresh and I will definitely come back!,5,Positive
"Ordered cava for delivery. They forgot half of the original order. That is just unacceptable for the cost ($50+ for two bowls) of the order itself. My delivery person was great and went back to receive the other half of my order. Unfortunately, my bowl was not proportionate it was barely any rice or protein and so much greens and sauce when I asked for light sauce. It was quite frankly disgusting. Never ordering from here again. Oh and to top it off the food was cold.",1,Negative
This place is absolutely amazing.   A new take on eating healthy. These salads are to Live for... There are about 1000 possible combinations and they all look good. I only tried about 3. My brother is in love with this place. He has to eat here aT least 4x  a week. They are great tho. I can make some recommendations but you should probably just get happy and try everything.     Enjoy!!!,5,Positive
"The food is okay, I've had cava before and it's usually a good meal. This location however has extremely rude staff, the service is slow and the quality of the food itself doesn't taste as good as other places. The seating area is also messy.",2,Negative
"I like the food but they got my order wrong.  I paid about $45 for the greens/grains salad with Harissa chicken salad with avocado, etc and they did not add the chicken or the avocado which I paid extra for.  Very annoyed.",2,Negative
Food is good but these people are so slow. I was in line during the lunch rush and it took more than 20 minutes to get to the register. You can see that they are not working at their best speed!,3,Negative
This was my first time experiencing mediterranean food. TJay & Mohammed provided Great Customer Service. They both were very efficient as I only had 30 minutes left on my lunch break to get my food. I appreciate them both. The food was great.,5,Positive
"This is my favorite place to eat in a rush. I won‚Äôt call it fast food because it‚Äôs healthy and of course you get served in a a fraction of a minute, great quality and taste definitely worts the money. I love to make my own salad and you can add grains to fill you up so it‚Äôs not just a simple salad. The only challenge is that not in every branch have a restroom.",5,Positive
Overall a great experience and good vibes! Service was fast and employees were super friendly. Had the pleasure of being served by Gabby and Rashon. Food was delicious! I think one of the best experiences I‚Äôve had at a ‚Äúfast food‚Äù place.,5,Positive
Always delicious really love their food. Haven‚Äôt had a bad experience yet. This particular location is very crowded so sometimes it takes them a little bit longer to get the food out but it‚Äôs always worth the wait.,5,Positive
"I love Cava in general, but this location is truly abysmal. I‚Äôve been 5 times. When ordering pick up or delivery, they make bowls with several missing ingredients. My most recent bowl was missing the extra falafel I paid for and the dressing‚Ä¶ it was just dry ingredients. When you go there after 7pm, they are constantly out of ingredients- like their main proteins- it‚Äôs really disappointing. The food is good but the logistics and service are poorly executed.",2,Negative
"This CAVA is run very well. I work nearby and pickup lunch here often. This location can be very busy during lunch, but the staff are polite and fast AF under pressure.

Edit: The portions are smaller now. -1*",4,Positive

Mr. Mohamed went above and beyond to understand and to make me feel comfortable which drove me to ask questions and I was able to get the food I really wanted. Mr, Mohamed made me feel as an appreciated customer. And will certainly continue visiting Cava Brooklyn Downtown. Thank you GBY!",5,Positive
I love this place..... It's a twist on the salad game. I appreciate it tho. So many different combinations to choose from. Was introduced by my younger brother and I'm hooked.,5,Positive

Felt very dirty. In the 5 mins we were there watched a guy making to go orders pick something up off the floor and go right back to making a bowl. Another guy making our bowls was using a recipe card that looked filthy. Another guy had his hands all over the rim of the ice bucket as refilling. Ended up throwing out our food out of concern of what was happening in the back if the front was that dirty.,1,Negative
"First time visiting and had an amazing experience!! Jahdinae was so helpful, she gave great recommendations and walked us through the whole menu. She needs a raise bc she was great!!!",5,Positive
"It is also a worker.  Do you discriminate against us because we deliver food?  This is the worst employee I have ever seen.  She is the shortest Mexican in the shop.  Her face was really bad, as if someone in the family had died.  If you do not want to do this and do not respect your profession, please go home.  Don't ruin Kava's praise here.  I hope your manager can see.  This is discriminatory against our food delivery.",1,Negative
"Awful experience, terrible supply chain. It takes 2-3 people to finish an order. Which keeps customers waiting for extended periods of time. Recently, we were there and apparently they only accepted cash and couldn‚Äôt accept credit card, much like a merchant vendor on the street. They requested my pregnant wife put in the order online, she attempted to but ran into complications with the app. We coordinated our schedules, so I went back to get the food later by placing an order for a future pickup. I waited for 30+ past the scheduled pickup. No one seemed concerned at all about these delays and kept acknowledging that my order was started, again a supply chain breakdown, ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt my job to finish it‚Äù. Terrible customer service and they‚Äôre always low on ingredient. This use to be a go to spot  for us during the week, but after this experience, it‚Äôs clear that Naya in the neighborhood will blow this place out of the water. I typically don‚Äôt complain, but there were no apologies and a lot of people that seemed like they don‚Äôt want to be there, so why would I?",1,Negative
"The flavor in this place is FANTASTIC. It's like Qdoba had a Mediterranean cousin, you can build your own meals (bowls, pita wraps) as you go down the counter. The staff helped me and my fam go from clueless to full and happy. Also nice outdoor seating with umbrellas, if needed. Great drink options, and possible plus for their paper-esque containers.
Definitely would go again, and try something new.",5,Positive
"Ordered spicy lamb meatball pita.
The order was left on front of another apartment's  door and I had to go and  search where it was, no phone call or text, and I sent this driver a text message with apartment number.
The meatballs were literally as out of the fridge. They messed up the order with an exaggerated amount of sauce, and no vegetables whatsoever, straight to the garbage. Will never order again; first and last.",1,Negative
"Cava is a pretty cool concept. Mediterranean flavors, choices of rice, pita or salad along with a main meat with various sides and dressings. The flavors of the food are great. 4 stars instead of 5 because I think employees need a bit more consideration on whether rice should be mixed with salad or where dressings as opposed to tahini or other dips.",4,Positive
Chipotle for Mediterranean food. Good quality ingredients with freshness in mind. Awesome selections of meats and sauces and salads. A little pricey but very clean tasting food and very satisfying. The staff is quick organize and very friendly. The line is long but goes very quick as the food is in a assembly line. They don‚Äôt give you half a spoon of meat and very generous. Very satisfying food Good selection of organic sodas and teas.,5,Positive

"Amazing fast casual, healthy Mediterranean food that‚Äôs a welcome addition to the Downtown Brooklyn food scene! The staff is so friendly and the mini pita with lamb was divine (and quite filling)! Highly recommend and can‚Äôt wait to try everything",5,Positive
"My office loves their food but the last couple orders were disappointing. 2occasions was some red hummus in friends salad and she didn't order hummus, which tells me they use the same spoon to scoop in multiple containers. The pita chips were burnt , and yes I'm being dramatic so that broke my heart . Also  $4 for a 2oz container of hummus is crazy .",3,Negative
"First time coming here, and honestly, it might be my last! I will NEVER understand why people apply for jobs just to have an attitude that they have to work, and on top of that, taking out their frustration on paying customers! Workers making unnecessary disrespectful comments about customers to their coworkers while standing RIGHT in front of said customers, forgetting orders and then having an attitude when it needs to be corrected, rolling their eyes and sighing when taking orders, waiting way too long for an order only to receive half of it, workers and managers on their phones, it‚Äôs all too much. I‚Äôve seen this EXACT behavior play out in other establishments and you know what happens? Either the manager gets fired due to incompetency, or the establishment shuts down due to lack of customers! I initially didn‚Äôt plan on coming back because of the below average food alone, but the attitude from everyone made me not want to come back. Shame on me for not listening to the reviews. Do better!",1,Negative

"poor service, no one is picking up any lines, i order online and there is no available tracking system although there is a link, NO ONE has been able to help.. the delivery was for 40 min ago now, horrible horrible online business with lack of management or customer support.",1,Negative
"Really poor service. They couldn't find my order, and after they did, they gave it to me 20 minutes later. Then I realized that it was incomplete, and when I told the waiter, she just walked away. Another waiter was nice enough to give what I thought was missing. When I got home I realized that they had also forgotten the avocado, which I had been charged for.
I am definitely not coming back.",1,Negative
Fresh and organics bowls made the way you like it! I would recommend this place to anyone who is trying to eat a healthy lunch.,5,Positive
So glad to see CAVA finally open in my neighborhood! The food is fresh and the service is fast! It seems that they have fully prepared for the grand opening. The experience on my first visit was much better than what I had in sg when it opened a few blocks away last year! Hope CAVA not run out of green harissa next time„ÉæÔæâ‚âß‚àÄ‚â¶)o,5,Positive

"Went with my family after lunch rush, so there was few options remaining. We were the only people in line, but there were workers just standing around and no one wanted to take our order. When we did order, every other option was missing, and the place was messy. The icing on the cake was when the cashier with red streaks in her hair, rung up two drinks instead of one. When I asked for a refund, she threw the nastiest look and just walked away. I was so confused. Another worker came to finish the refund. The food was really good, but the customer service sucked.",1,Negative
"Went at the end of the night because we're/she's hooked and although they were already breaking things down, they were super efficient and attentive with it. The food was still fresh, amazing, and flavorful. The workers were friendly, accommodating, and all around pleasurable. Plus, the price was about the same as it was in locations I'd visited in DC and VA. Highly highly recommend (and you'll feel good too... Thank me later... seriously, I'm here for your health)... You're welcome... Also, the harissa, roasted eggplant and roasted red pepper hummus with the garlic dressing... You're welcome again",5,Positive
Love it. Amazing food you can not go wrong,5,Positive
"Actually, there's a park across the street that I chill in. A friend of mine purchased a salad from there and, she let me have it after I tasted. Plus, the area is provides a great dinning outing for all, with the option of strolling across two bridges into the city. Safe travels. Peace!",5,Positive
"This specific cava location has the most unapproachable attitude, even chipotle don‚Äôt act like this. They are extremely disengaged, rude, and disrespectful. They become easily impatient and annoyed with the most simple request. It was as if they weren‚Äôt expecting customers to come into the establishment. Very disappointing overall you‚Äôre better off walking to shake shack that‚Äôs nearby.",1,Negative
"Love Cava food and there restaurants but this particular location always starts to close at 9pm. This is my 3rd attempt, this time it was 9:08 p.m. and they had already put away the topings. The employee was courteous enough to say they are open until 10 p.m. but they had already put away the toppings. What would be the point? Why not just close the doors at 9 p.m. to avoid the customer frustration rather than  have customers hope that you are available for services until 10 p.m. Btw 3 people walked in walked out with the same frustrations. This is a bad business practice.",1,Negative
Never ever go to this place between 12-3.  Doesn't matter if you order ahead.  Zero organization.  No one knows what they are supposed to be doing.,2,Negative
"The quality of service has changed drastically.
You'll end up.paying for the bowl and not the little contents. My excitement fizzled in 0.1 second.
Maybe I'll give CAVA another try midtown.",1,Negative
Amazinggg!!!! Brianna and Bryanna are great workers. They are the digital ordering team and always sends my order out on time and makes sure everything is correct never disappointed they deserve a raise!!!!üôÇ,5,Positive
"The service is consistently horrible at this location. Staff don‚Äôt seem to care or are trained. I went there at 5pm and it took me 20 minutes to get my food (there was no line) just slow, uncaring and untrained staff.  The bowls were only half full since she had no idea how much food should go in. Told me they were out of corn for the rest of the day while another staff came in to do a refill. Skip if you have other options. It is just disappointing since the food is good but boy not worth the aggravation.",2,Negative
"A really disappointing location and experience with this CAVA. The food is routinely not fresh, they consistently reuse old meat from previous days without even reheating it - have been served near frozen meat on a warm bowl on 2 occasions, which is 2 times too many.

Salad leaves are always wilted at this location - they under portion all the bowls and ROUTINELY skip items in orders to the point where orders feel unrecognizable. Also NEVER include the free pita, even when requested.

This location is offensively disappointing and subpar.",1,Negative
Used to be one of the best spots around. Since past few months the service quality has gone down the drain. Online orders when picked up missed half of the dressings and toppings. Sometimes they even left the proteins out. The side pita is just non existent.,1,Negative
"The bathrooms are disgusting. Customer service is rude, and I found a hair in my food. Never there again.",1,Negative
First time i went food and service was good.however on 4/12/22  smh ü§¶. Staff was unprofessional and service was unsanitary. With bare hands there was a girl  employee eating a bowl of peter chips beyond the counter where food ordering takes place. She then put gloves .onnand started  to take  orders. Hair nets was not on the correct way.the guy bringing the rice out was tallking to another co worker using all type of inappropriate  words. Then it gets worse i get home eat my food and there is a long hair in it. Drf calling corporate  if i can find a number.,1,Negative
"I honestly don't even want to give this place a single star, that's how bad it is. This is the second time I've ordered online from there and both times it was missing almost half of the ingredients. The first time, I let it go and didn't complain. However, this time the bowl was barely half full. Not to mention, the few times I've visited the location and was met with a hostile environment created by the managers/workers that are consistently yelling at each other. Do not eat here, not worth spending your money.

In addition, I reached out directly to CAVA for a refund, however after sending multiple follow ups, no one from the customer service team ever responded or issued a refund.",1,Negative
Great location for a quick bite. Food was good but the door makes a horrible slamming noise every time it was open or shut.,4,Positive
"Wow, what‚Äôs going on with this place. Either a bad manager or a total loss of organizational skills. During lunchtime they have no napkins, half of the ingredients are missing, two out of seven dressings, no forks, no spoons, garbage on the floor, people going without purpose back-and-forth behind the counter. I ordered takeout took 45 minutes beyond the time specified for the pick up. Unbelievable.",1,Negative
"Great general manager Mohamed, I recommend this Cava to everyone
04/11/23",5,Positive
"Great food, but don‚Äôt order online! I was eating this everyday consistently but because of the amount of errors, I only go there when I have the time to wait online. Paying for double meat? I only end up with single, meat balls? I end up with chicken.  So again, food is always good, but the online ordering and pick up is not worth it.",3,Negative
"‚ÄòNo bowls today‚Äô

Basically paying the same amount of money for less food.

Seems silly to have all these greens go to waste. Everything was an up charge. I gave three stars because at the register they gave me some lentils.",3,Negative
"I go there a few times weekly because of its proximity ti my job. Lettuce most times is withered and everytime I ask it's always ""we just put that there"". Sorry but I'm not paying $14 for withered lettuce. Staff is also not very customer oriented.",1,Negative
"I love Cava, and all other Cava locations except for this one.

I have ordered many times from this Cava and every single time, things are missing from the bowl or plain wrong, not to mention constantly late - sometimes for over and hour late. I feel bad for the poor delivery drivers losing time and money waiting for this Cava location to make 1 or 2 bowls‚Ä¶

Cava corporate should seriously look at this location‚Äôs management and operations, or shut it down. This location is ruining the reputation and good name of Cava. If this happens to be the first and only Cava you‚Äôve interacted with, there‚Äôs a >50% chance you never go to any Cava ever again - it‚Äôs that bad

Cava corporate, please read this and the other reviews, fix this store and its staff, retrain the entire team and please. I want nothing more than to support you and give you my money, but this store is absolutely embarrassing.",1,Negative
Usually this place is good. Today I was given hard burnt brown rice after I told the lady I didn‚Äôt want hard rice. I asked if there was a fresh pot and was told no with an attitude and she did not even check. The veggies looked old. I‚Äôm hoping this was a one off.,2,Negative
"I‚Äôve been going here consistently since it opened, and the service has been terrible the past couple of months. And worse I got there at 7pm and they were out of most topping options. I ended up paying too much for just rice, lettuce, cucumbers and corn. While I was there, a worker was also screaming at a food delivery guy. I hope things change cause I actually love the food at CAVA.",1,Negative
"Friendly staff & food is good BUT service is HORRIBLE. The service has severely declined in the past two months, by 6 pm and they close at 9pm there is NEVER a full menu. Menu items and dressing are always finished. NO ONIONS, NO CUCUMBERS, NO GARLIC DRESSING, NO PITA CRISP. Bins are displayed full of onions but prepared etc. There is no reason the staff is not well prepared to have the food items cut, cooked and or prepared for the evening rush. Food is not appealing the area is sloppy. I‚Äôve recently stopped going since I‚Äôm not able to get everything I would like to in my salad for $13-$16 meal. This restaurant needs better management before it really goes down hill. I‚ÄôM HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. now I will have to find digester else to eat ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. hopefully someone can save this location.",1,Negative
Love the food. Will come back,5,Positive
"Line is also super slow. They have way too many employees that just stand around instead of helping the line move. The employees are always super rude. The food is ok I guess but it is definitely not worth the wait, which is always crazy long.",1,Negative
"Almost 4 stars because the staff didn't seem happy. They need a vacation! Working hard- they probably need more money! Food was good and fresh, salads were healthy and food was just right! The $ also fairly priced. Could be a tad cleaner.",5,Positive
The salads are actually filling and I really like the wide variety of topings,5,Positive
"On March 5th, my wife and I were were served at the Metro Tech location which we both agreed that the service/ food was excellent. However, unfortunately my visit to the facility's restroom I found it deplorable and disgusting. The toilet had never been cleaned, the three essential items required to complete the process was missing, ie; toilet paper, hand soap and paper towels. I have visited third world countries and found better facilities than the restroom at at Cava Metro Tech in Brooklyn.",4,Positive
Great tasting bowls with fresh ingredients. Expect to wait in line around lunch time for ~10-15 minutes. They have a great discount for emergency service workers.,5,Positive
If this place is located in New York City I think yes I was there I had a chicken sandwich. It was delicious very good and careful what I eat and a mayonnaise was just ride was over too much just like the Santa's real nice my daughter had the pizza all,4,Positive
Food is delicious but it gets really crowded.  The lines move kind of fast depending on if you know what you want.,4,Positive
Service is always fast and friendly. Food is always delish!,5,Positive
"I like CAVA a lot, but this location is the worst. Every single time I go there they are running out of something! Most of the times I need to wait for 5 minutes until some one who is absolutely doing nothing comes up to me to ask me what I want to order. I`m guessing there should be a guideline for the operators for how much they fill in the bowls, and people who work here don`t follow that! Everywhere else I go I get almost double the portions I get in this location. This location needs serious management improvement.",2,Negative
"So I'm a happy camper who always leave 5 star reviews because I know everyone (usually) cares and tries their best! And I'm a huge fan of Cava overall! But this specific location is absolutely, entirely, fully, truly, (any other adverbs?) bogus and terrible.

They CONSTANTLY take well over 1 hour 15 to prepare an Uber eats order of 1 salad - I won't receive my food anything short of 1 hour 45 for a 15 minute distance for delivery. FIVE times in a row (I know I should just give up already but I really love their food), but 5 times in a row, over a 3 month period, it has take them WELL over 1 hour 15 to actually prepare my food. I'm at my last order today (because I'll no longer order from them) and they took SO long, that I tracked 2 different cyclists who showed up to pick up my order, they waited for 15 minutes, then left because my food was not ready.  First cyclist showed up 30 minutes after I placed my order, seems reasonable, second showed up 50 minutes after I placed my order, also more than reasonable. Now its raining so noone else will be showing up, but I had TWO different delivery guys waiting to do their job.

This is literally the worst location I've ever encountered in my life. They obviously don't care and I cannot express strongly enough how disappointed I am in their lack of interest in getting an order out. Guys, it's just ONE SALAD. It's very clear this location does NOT actually care about getting a job done. The owner should be ashamed of their staff.",1,Negative
The food was great the servers... not so much... but the location was clean the bathroom was clean. Just wish the server was more professional.,5,Positive
Love T and Irene was amazing love them come here and ask for them theyre awesome,5,Positive
Very fresh ingredients and very yummy sauces.,5,Positive
"normally don't want to leave a bad review, but staff was rude and wasn't able to give correct change because they were out of ones. ended up paying $15 for a $10 bowl. they were also out of half the ingredients at 845 pm :( so the bowl was not filling.",1,Negative
"0 STARS! The way how cava general managers treat there employees is DIGUSTING! Literally every cava store managers are horrible!! At this point, I think Cava is just hiring anybody to be a manager. They treat there employees like they aren‚Äôt human, very rude, slick remarks I can go on. Jennifer the General Manager at this downtown location is so rude and disgusting to her employees and the other employees sent to this store for the day to help out. She talks about the employees to other employees loudly so the person she is talking about can hear her..verbal abuse! Unprofessional!

The way how they treat there employees I will NEVER EAT FROM HERE. & you wonder why every month it‚Äôs another general manager or different staff!! MANAGEMENT IS TERRIBLE!!! STAFF EMPLOYMENT RATE MUST BE AT 0. EVERYONE QUITS AFTER A WEEK. DO BETTER!!!!",1,Negative
"Great service, food, and friendly staff",5,Positive
Food was fresh and delicious. Staff was was patient with us as first time patrons. I would definitely eat at CAVA again and recommend to others.,5,Positive
Food is amazing staff is very friendly,5,Positive
Ordered the Chicken + RightRice bowl and the Spicy Chicken + Avocado Pita. Both tasted great! The Lemonade is too sweet; all Cava locations I‚Äôve been to have this problem though.,4,Positive
"Love cava generally and always go to the one in Chelsea. The dumbo location is terrible, doesn‚Äôt seem to be a manager to notice/address the very clear issues with the stores staff",2,Negative
I walked in and walked back out. The food area was a mess.,1,Negative
Real quick and health choice of food here. 1st time here and just sampled a Mediterranean bowl and it was delish. Will definitely visit again next time I'm in the area. I recommend a visit if you are near the area.,5,Positive
"Food was below expectations and customer service was terrible, they are rude don‚Äôt respond to your questions, glued to their phones even the alleged manager had a hostile demeanor from the start‚Ä¶ shocking",1,Negative
"Favorite salads hand down! So many unique toppings and flavor profiles to choose from and create something different each time. Flavor explosion is an understatement. Youcna never get bored a salad eating here,highly recommend!",5,Positive
"Pretty good. I came in here pretty late and the food was still hot and fresh with most options still available. The harissa sauce is really delicious, and the portions were generous. Happy this place made it to Brooklyn. I think the hype is worth it.",5,Positive
Don‚Äôt know why the staff are all completing online orders and idling around while there‚Äôs a line waiting to order. They tell me they‚Äôre out of pita crisp but made it specifically for the person before me?? Rude staff and horrible service,1,Negative
The staff is very rude. Almost throwing the food in the bowl. They also always seem to have run out of dressing and dips and do not even put proper quantity like the other cava locations,1,Negative
"Cava, you've won me over. Healthy vsriety of greens, veges and tasty dressings. Now I know why you had a long line. Highly recommended.",5,Positive
"I ordered Pita for Lunch and Salad for dinner. In town for a funeral and working all day at hotel so I can be present for funeral. I ordered via uber eats so I can keep working. I checked off include utensils. The receipt CAVA printed and put inside the sealed bag, said include utensils. There was none and I am in a hotel with no way of consuming their salad.

Called them back and the young woman asked: ""is there any way I can walk there to get it""!!! I ordered instead of fumbling out of hotel to find food near me to save time.  Her next option was for me to call Uber. I stated they DID NOT pack the sealed bag and forgot the utensils. She said I know but you ordered through a 3rd party and we have no runners.

Anyone with a modicum of intelligence or rather just basic knowledge knows there is NO uber number to call, hence calling the establishment that fulfilled and did not include the utensils in the order. Needless to say I have a salad sitting here with the following choices CAVA has left me. Peck with my mouth and hands.  Not eat it all and waste my money so I can find another place to order dinner from. VERY Disappointed this was the response to someone #1 trying restaurant for first time #2 from out of town #3 clearly not able to walk to establishment hence I would have to begin with.",1,Negative
"Food is amazing , the staff was amazing outside of this one female manager who rudely walked away and I was inquiring about something today at noon .. I‚Äôm not please because I am big on customer service , love this place & she‚Äôs a Bad example for the rest of the workers (very unprofessional). Outside of that this food is BOMB & i appreciate the good customer service the rest of the staff had. Still one of my faves regardless & Def. a must try !!",4,Positive
"Worst customer service at this place. Girl at the front was extremely rude and slow. I am a very nice person and never complain on waiting especially when I see that they are busy. She was serving people who walked after me and skipped me 5 times. After a guy came and said it's his lunch break and I have to wait. Anyway, next time I wont be coming in here as clearly this place is very disorganized and people who work there dont want to help. FYI, go to city location, at least their customer service is good.",1,Negative
Lines move super slow and obviously grow super long! Then once they were out of falafel and staff had no clue how long will it take to be ready - absolute state of confusion and i ended up getting veggies instead that i did not even want. Falafel tastes sub par. Spread of vegetables and sauces is great. Bowls are value for money while regular Pita pockets seem overpriced compared to the bowls. Staff seems unhappy.,2,Negative
"Far be it from me to disrespect service workers right now of all times, but the cashier was handling food and money without removing their gloves and that's disgusting. That's a sign of seriously bad management and training.",2,Negative
Great food and many options for vegetarians. Mix and match dressings to create different flavors every time. One of my quick to-go places. You can order in advance through their app to avoid waiting in long lines.,5,Positive
"The food is on consistent with other Cava locations, however the staff is extremely unhelpful and seemingly understaffed. Often, with no line at all, it will be over 5 minutes before they acknowledge you in line. This leads me to consistently take business elsewhere. When finally served, they are extremely unprofessional. Orders ahead of time via the app are consistently not ready in time.",2,Negative
"Great food, can‚Äôt complain. Only gripe is ordering ahead doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get your food at the proposed time - even though it‚Äôs empty. Not a big deal though.",4,Positive
"Love the food.
Alot of the workers seem unhappy and annoyed when you ask for certain items. üòí ‚Ä¶",4,Neutral
Food was amazing but the staff needs to take a refresher course on customer service. Rude and rushed the entire order. I asked question upon some food items and I was given rushed answers with attitude.,3,Negative
"Came here for the first time for lunch because a friend suggested it, and it was great! Good food and great value, very healthy portion for how inexpensive it is. A lot of these Mediterranean ‚Äúchipotle‚Äù style joints have opened the pst few years, this is easily one of my favorites now. If you plan on going for lunch, I recommend ordering ahead. Waiting in line takes at least 20 minutes, but the food is worth it!",5,Positive
Ordered twice.  Got the order completely wrong both times,1,Negative
Food was fresh and delicious.,4,Positive
Delicious food at a decent price. Long line to order and only one cashier working during the lunch rush. Still worth the wait.,4,Positive
"Mediterranean chipotle but better.
Staffs are super helpful when it was my first time visiting. They gave me great recommendations as well.
Their pickled onions are wonderful. The texture is firm and chewy, giving your bowl or your pitas a good combination.
Seatings are rare during lunch hours but during the nicer weather, plenty of seatings outside.",5,Positive
"Great food but the employees are not friendly. A lot of attitudes and rolling eyes she literally slammed my bowl and was preparing my toppings very aggressively till one of the beefballs fell out to the floor,  luckily Im a changed woman. I walked away feeling like why did I pay for my food I shoulda just left. That was a very bad experience and my last time at this location.",1,Negative
"This was close to the Marriott and was convenient. I needed a low carb menu and this fit the bill with their salad option.

When I walked in I was immediately confused about how to order. The start of the counter was a couple guys talking and doing food prep. I looked over the signs and was lost, almost left, there wasn‚Äôt a menu, just signs. But a lady at the counter asked if she could help. Since I‚Äôm not one to run away or back down from a challenge I said I‚Äôd never been in and would like to order but didn‚Äôt know how it worked. Then the game started!

To make a long story short, you have to pick a base (a green (which there are at least 5 options) a pita, or combination)then sauce, then protein (or other), then toppings, then dressing. Forgive my poor use of parentheses. All of these options are printed on a single card in front of the cafeteria ladies serving area so there‚Äôs no way to identify which is which. Luckily enough I‚Äôm food savvy enough to know by sight 25% of what each bin held. Just picture a Subway sandwich shop with trays of mostly unidentifiable food and one sign that names them all.

This is what you face! Good luck, I don‚Äôt honk Gordon Ramsey could identify them all.

So if you‚Äôve read this far you‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúBrian, why isn‚Äôt this a one star review?‚Äù Well the truth is, I plowed through the mystery and actually ended up with a decent meal. They just need to work on the presentation of their menu and ordering system. The food itself would never award a 5 star but maybe they can get close to 4.",2,Negative
"Today at the Brooklyn store they ran out of meatballs, chicken, feta cheese and pita bits.  Seemed very disorganized when usually you are spot on. The employees were pleasant it must have been a wicked day.",4,Positive
"I would of given because I love the food, but the night team at the brooklyn cava is very sloppy. I first found out about the restaurant, when I was in San Diego. I fell in love with food, and also my 12 yrs old daughter. After I found out they have one downtown Brooklyn close to my job. I was so happy.
The only thing wrong with that place is the servers. They are not doing a proper job with putting the food together. It looks sloppy and nasty.",3,Neutral

"Customer service was horrible the server was rude and racist every time we ask for something she kept telling us we don‚Äôt have it and after we finished and payed she restocked literally served the person behind me and gave it to him while I still was at the store . Don‚Äôt work if your gonna give bad attitude, very horrible (she‚Äôs dark skin, short and chubby with a bad attitude she should get fired ? + she was on the phone chatting during the service üëéüèªüëéüèª",1,Negative
This was my first time coming in tonight. Felt so welcoming. I usually don‚Äôt leave reviews but the young lady who helped was so informative & took her time with me explaining everything. Everything down to the beverages and what they contain. Just wanted to say thank you. You will be seeing me again.,5,Positive
A fun modern take on traditional Middle Eastern food. Tasty and convenient. Lots of options and variety. Also the space was clean and adhered to all covid regulations.,4,Positive
Is it understaffed? Unclear. I had to wait 25 minutes after my scheduled pickup time for the food to be ready. Not sure it even made sense to order on their app.,1,Negative
"They have steadily dropped in quality and service since they opened.  Napkins, utensils ice are regularly empty and they are regularly screwing up on internet orders. Staff is not friendly or professional",3,Negative

Always great fresh food available. Fast service and great customer service,5,Positive
"I like Cava Food.  Healthy and fresh. Should take more attention to locations cleaning and change the water fonts' filters more frequently.   I went to Cava downtown Brooklyn on 09/2021. I asked for the same salad that I always ask, this time it was TOO SALTY. No sure why this Brooklyn location used so much salt in the food. The Cava near Union square is for me the best. Best service, cleaner, no too much salt in the food. Cava is not as good as it was when it started.",2,Negative
"Always love cava best balanced meals and amazing spices love this place. Now adding that don't order online, I don't know but it took wayyyyy too long for an online order I would just order in person.",5,Positive

My order was messed up on 2 different occasions but overall..the taste and quality  is great..very fresh ingredients..prefer this over Chipotle .,4,Positive
Great service when it‚Äôs not busy crazy,5,Positive
Not my kind of food - way too plain.  Their falafels are not good.  They should not be called falafels.  There are better similar food choices on Atlantic Ave and they are not far from CAVA Downtown Brooklyn.,1,Negative
So good! Wish we had these in Austin!,5,Positive
"Good food, fair service. Better Mediterranean food than some restaurants, if served in a distinctly American fast-food-like way, as a series of stations not unlike Chipotle.",5,Positive

"The food is amazing always cooked fresh and tasty thanks to TJ ,always appreciate the amazing service from staff and manager Mohamed",5,Positive
We visited Cava while visiting the Brooklyn bridge. The staff was very helpful explaining the menu since it was our first time there. They are like a chipotle with more unique options. The food was good and seemed fresh. The spicy chicken is quite spicy but it wasn‚Äôt unbearable. The drinks were really tasty. We tried all of their juices & liked them all.,4,Positive
TJ and Mohammad are good dudes. Cava is him.,5,Positive

Tj and Mohammed were very helpful and provided excellent service as did the rest of the staff. Great experience overall.,5,Positive
If u are ordering through doordash or Uber etc‚Ä¶ Walk ins are served before delivery pick up . Don‚Äôt matter if you call and already paid . ETA at lunch or dinner can easily be 30 min wait for pick up. Workers start making the food when we show them the phone app . But they are suppose to make the food before we get to Cava. Management needs to be better organized to fulfill deliveries instead of putting deliveries to the side . At times there are ten delivery persons waiting patiently for food to be ready .,1,Negative
"We ate well, nothing special but comfortable and fast",4,Neutral
Visited the store for the first time. The ambience doesn't have much to offer here whereas the service was average. I had ordered a whopper and classic fries. The staff forgot to give me ketchup packets. The whopper patty wasn't fresh and guess that's one issue with these big chain restaurants though I liked the fries as they were hot!,2,Negative
Terrible customer service. My SMALL fry was half way full. I politely asked her for just a little more and she refused. I had to argue with the MANGER (short Hispanic woman) to give me more fries. Her attitude was also unprofessional.,1,Negative
Of All the people that work there I did not think I was gonna get an attitude from the manager generia  worst person to work at a restaurant and it was all over a little bit tartars sauce Will be sending this to corporate I know how this works,1,Negative
Order ahead service was great. Set up my order through the app and it was hot and ready when I pulled into the drive thru. Minimal wait time.,5,Positive
It's one of the better Burger Kings I've been to for food. It's not a good environment for kids.,4,Positive
"I saw the 3.3 rating but was hopeful that the food wouldn't be so bad. Not only was the customer service poor but the food was awful. Burgers were cold and half of the fries we ordered were stale. Onion rings were pretty good though, that's why they got two star instead of zero.",2,Negative
"Worst customer service ever. Food is cold and moldy. The employees all just talk and ignore people that are trying to order their food. I was once there and there was a line of 3 or 4 peopld ( keep in mind barely anyone goes to this burger king because its well known for its poor customer service and bad food quality ) and nobody was served. They also ignored this poor man who was asking for his food he bought and they completely ignored him until he raised his voice. I would rate it 1/10, but its not even in that number scale, its in the negatives. Shut down this burger king in this spot, and put a mcdonalds or something. Or atleast change the management and employees for godsake.",1,Negative
They forgot my order to put it inside the bag because when I got home I saw there one item so They took my money,1,Negative
New guy is a little slow but place always clean and food hot,4,Neutral
Workwear windows is polite but the drive thru is so skin and small needs better direction signs or you‚Äôll pass right by it,3,Neutral
They never get the order right.  It's so annoying. I yell them no ketchup because I'm a diabetic and every single time they put ketchup in the burger!!,1,Negative
"Not a good Burger King. Ordered in advance to keep it quick but when I arrived they didn‚Äôt have any prior knowledge of the order. Then looked and said they didn‚Äôt receive it then upon a second and third person checking to see it in their system, they finally found it. I then had to wait for them to make it from scratch. Received the buns and burger Patties totally burned and every bite only tasted of char. On top of all that, my girlfriend and i each had stomach aches and digestive issues after. Employees seem not to have it together. as I was waiting and watching other customers had issues. It‚Äôs Burger King so you shouldn‚Äôt have high expectations to begin with but you‚Äôre better off going anywhere else nearby.",1,Negative
Worst b.k ever. Walk in and all the workers literally stood talking to each other.  We stood at the register and not one of them stopped talking to even look at us. We walked out and they didn't even turn their head. Half the lights are out. No heat. And the place was filthy. The screen for the menu doesn't even work. And they tell u cash only. Pretty sure they just keep the money and don't even ring in the food.,1,Negative
"Though the store was renovated a few years back, the quality and service is sub-par.",2,Negative
"Today's experience Jan 3rd 2021 convinced my wife and I to never come here again! While on our 45 min. LUNCH I spent approximately 30 minutes in drive thru to drive away without a unprofessional manager or employee to alert the customers or ask for my order or apologize for wasting my time. I left in such a rage I wanted to curse at the MANA-JERK in charge, but no one came to the window. This establishment needs to hire professional people to lead. Simple if you have no employees to work!!! WHY OPEN?!! This is not a good time to mess with people's food or stomach. Close your establishment down because this is FALSE advertisement especially if you have no workers at work. NOW I'm at work hungry with nothing in my stomach and will make sure to spread the news around the school building to avoid this Burger King location at all cost. Especially when it's draining valuable time for people who actually work.Terrible experience!!!",1,Negative
"This particular location is not a pleasant one. Although it literally took 2 minutes for me to receive my food, it was very cold and wasn't fresh at all. I ordered via the drive thru and could see the facility was quite filthy. Staff seemed to be over worked as I witnessed one person trying to do three separate jobs all at once while still trying to handle orders at the drive thru window. Whoever owns this franchise, please think about investing in training staff to keep your business cleaner and try to keep all oders fresh, it'll attract more customers than you think.",1,Negative
This BurgerKing needs a better Store Manger . The assistant manger are always rude . They make you feel rushed and don‚Äôt even get the order right the first time . I‚Äôve went here multiple time and feel like this is just normal for them to mistreat there customers! If you‚Äôre looking for that A one customer service it‚Äôs not here go to Bergenline instead at least they get your order right the first time and give you sauce !,3,Negative
"I was there in night for pick up Uber eats order.  restaurant was winded up and 1 order was ready on table. Door was locked, I knock the window from outside there is 2 lady inside saw me and ignore me. I try to talk many times but nobody come. At the end I had to cancel order.  Please respond at least order is ready sooo.",3,Negative
"I've placed an order through the Grub Hub App but My Order was Incomplete.
I placed my order from the Burger King restaurant store #2367 in Jersey City, NJ
There is a phone number of this Burger King I ordered from and surprise surprise, the number is not in service.
Then when I tried to Google search the number on their website, the number was different from the number on the receipt and Once Again to My Surprise, that number is Also Not in Service.
So Basically I paid for an incomplete meal and was not refunded or compensated. This is Extremely Unacceptable & Unprofessional to Not have an working contact number to address this issue",1,Negative
"Where to start? I been to so many BK chain restaurants and other fast food chains, this is by far the worst location I have been in all fast food restaurants. I have to say I have low expectations to start off with considering this is just fast food restaurant. I usually don‚Äôt like to rate based on one time visit, I been to this restaurant drive thru several times and not a single once they got the order correct, it is always missing/incomplete in the beginning I would always discover it when I‚Äôm already home. There has been multiple times where I order using the app I would go to the pick up window and say they ran out of the item and I have to connect with Customer service in the app to get refunded. Also, when I order in the app, I select ‚Äúdive thru‚Äù pick up and the lady always insist for me to come inside and I explain, I have kids in the car that‚Äôs why I selected pick up window in the mobile order. Also, when I‚Äôm being asked ‚Äúhow may I help you‚Äù as soon as I start the order, the lady says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it‚Äù and continues on repeating it multiple times and I am considered that I speak fast so I‚Äôm not a slow speaker, otherwise I would understand that she is trying to take order. Drive  thru speaker system is horrible, you have to repeat each order at least 3 times for them to hear it, then regardless they will get it wrong. Many many years ago I worked at Wendy and I know how the drive thought timing works, so to cheat the system, they tell all cars to wait in the parking lot for their order, this shows that they are on time with there driver thru orders, total lie because I can be waiting  in the car for over 10 mins. I would recommend to remove drive through timer because it‚Äôs being worked around and don‚Äôt represent actual time the order gets completed. Finally, if there is such a competition for being worst fast food restaurant location this location would to totally win it with flying colors for, bad attitude, quality of food, timeliness, in complete and wrong orders, you name it.",1,Negative
"The manager isn't doing anything except being on her phone. The person who cooked it didn't heat up my sandwiches , this is the WORST burger King ( b k ) EVER ! DON'T expect me to go there again!",1,Negative
"Never again, Worst service ever. Ordered the Your way meal and they gave me nothing close to it",1,Negative
I would give this place a 0 stars if I could. Everytime I go here the burgers are always cold. We all know that they reheat the food so why is it that they can't at least give their customers hot sandwiches that we pay for. The app tries to rob you when in the store 10pc nuggets are 1.49 and on the app it's 5.19 like what!. The owner needs to reevaluate the staff and make sure that they are doing theirs jobs to the highest standards of this franchise.,1,Negative
"This is the 3rd and last time I place order thru Uber it is always wrong and Uber is so disrespectful that they just refund your money as if you were a begger.
They have no Customer Service truly sad!",1,Negative
"This burger king is the absolute WORST. Soda's are flat, food is cold, core of lettuce heads, speaker in drive thru doesn't work the list can go on about this location. It's disgusting better off heading down the block to McDonalds.",1,Negative
"I tried to order the 2 for $10 combo today (with mix-n-match sandwiches available). The offer was  DISPLAYED ON THE MENU, right above the register.  The woman who took my order (wearing all black, a manager perhaps?) tried to punch it in and couldn't figure it out.  Took some time. Then she rudely tells me the sandwich I want is NOT part of the Promo. I literally point above her head to say she's wrong, it's offered right there on the menu.  She looks at it, tries again on her register, mumbling the whole time.  Now a line is forming behind us.  After many minutes of standing there, I guess she finally gets it so she rudely yells ""$10.66"" and walks away...  No apology for her mistake.  No apology for causing delay.  Nothing.  It doesn't bode well for a branch when an employee tries to deny you an offer that is literally being displayed above their head.",2,Negative
"Today I order burgers from this location @8:20 pm I had some kids at home ( family bundle offer $12.99) order number 7. the order processed the driver started moving was watching on the map ,it‚Äôs almost 9:30 an one hour , when the driver was approaching near by the app went to reload. In this COVID I mentioned inn once the drive near home to call me. But final near appeared. Such disappointment. Final I order from DOMINO‚ÄôS pizza there were the best ever I got my dinner on time in less then 30 mints . This 330 central Ave the worst service. I‚Äôm waiting for my refund.",1,Negative
"Place is disgusting, rundown and looks like it hasn‚Äôt been touched or cleaned in years. Lord knows how they‚Äôve passed their health inspection..",1,Negative
"This Burger King either needs a complete staff replacement or better yet to be shut down. Order is never correct when ask to correct order all you get is attitude. Place is always dirty, food barely cooked. You wait forever to place an order or to get your food.",1,Negative
"Really not trying to be petty but good grief this particular location is a mess. Everytime I order here, at least one thing is wrong, at least one thing every single time! Today, 4 orders for 4 people and 3 sauces. I ask for more and woman behind counter tells me I gotta pay for more ugh. Then the drinks are wrong. It's always something and the attitudes behind the counter are completely frustrating. They mess up the order and when I mention something, I get an attitude? Hire new people.",1,Negative
"This location is a sorry excuse for a Burger King.. I ordered 10 for 1$ nuggets and they were as if they had been made a hour or two ago and were waiting to be purchased.. Then my cheeseburger the burger was the same exact thing like it has been sitting waiting to be sold. The cheese wasn't melted let alone the burger was only just about room temperature.

FYI, this BK was not clean/sanitary  at all @ 12-1pm

There is one television and its by the ordering station. For that don't put any tv since its in a position where no customer can watch and eat even if it is just the news.

Overall the worst experience I dealt with when dealing with Burger King.",1,Negative
"Don‚Äôt use the app. It‚Äôs inaccurate. Also, they said my food was one the way 3 times over and it never came. Then I called the delivery driver...he said they gave the food to another delivery driver......ok cool... but neither of them came ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è . Go literally ANYWHERE ELSE  üëé  This is to be expected from a chain like this. Who‚Äôs the idiot now? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1,Negative
Fast and friendly service. Very clean dinning room,4,Positive
Visited this place at 714 am. No one was there. No one answered me in the drive thru and no one came to the window either. When do you open??? When does anyone come in??,1,Negative
"The people there can be nice at times and they can improve, but it can be a nice place for a quick bite. They do try to keep the place clean and the food there is alright but might take a while for you to get it. Most people here take it to go but other than that, its almost like any other Burger King.",4,Neutral
"Used to be a nice place when the previous staff used to be there. Now there are a bunch of rude, unmotivated employees who hand you the wrong order. Also, the 2 times I ordered with Uber Eats from here, they missed an item. I felt bad for the Uber driver who had to go back to get the missing milkshake for my pregnant wife.",1,Negative
"Opted for the 2 for $7 Offer and went with 2 Impossible Kings. Without any tomato or lettuce, the Impossible King is not a balanced burger. What makes it particularly unappetizing are the SUPER SALTY pickles they put in it.",2,Negative
Got the 3 for 3 menu double cheeseburger french fries and a dr pepper. Also got an order of onion rings that tasted burnt and old. They were over cooked. Didn't want to go back to get fresh onion rings because I was already driving home. Can't wait to be able to eat in the restaurant so that you can get your order fixed.,3,Negative
"Maybe it was just an off day, but when I went there it sucked, and I mean compared to fast food standards, not 5-star restaurant standards. The burger was poorly made and thrown together and not very tasty, and when I asked for a cup of water they said they didn't have any. Free water is like half the draw of grabbing a quick bite at a drive thru, come on, how cheap can you be!!",1,Negative
"The organization sets standards with respect to timely drive through service which the management of this location clearly override by having drive through customers park in an adjacent lot so that the clock can stop running, indicating the service was provided in a matter of a few seconds ... Bottom line, I don't care if I have to a little wait longer for a fesh, hot meal! Unfortunately often when I've pulled over, that's not what I received, sometimes the order brought out was completely wrong! ‚òπÔ∏è",1,Negative
"I went with my wife & used 2 coupons so I didn't have to tell cashier anything but that it was to dine in. They had me waiting for 25 minutes & I couldn't vent because servers were grilling me & mumbling about my face because I was about to explode of rage. Once order was done it was handed to me in a bag. When I said   it was to dine in, she put a tray under bag. She asked me anything else,  I said ketchup,  she pulled out 2 hands full of ketchup & threw it on my tray. I couldn't believe I was assaulted at Burger King.  I will share my story for ever. McDonald's will love me from here on. I rated 0",1,Negative
"I am always greeted by a friendly face and wonderful service. I usually treat my brother to a meal there ( Passaic-Wallington bridge) and he absolutely loves their selections. We usually sit inside and enjoy a visit there and we are never rushed out. I have never been disappointed by their food. In Jersey City-Central Avenue, I visit with my Mom and she too loves their food. She frequents that location and goes there at least once a week. The staff is very kind and helpful to her. We have never been disappointed by their food.",5,Positive
"The ""Assistant Manager"" that is taking drive thru orders this very second is very nasty. Car full of kids so my order is very large. She was huffing and puffing and kept asking is a nasty tone if I was finished. Didn't ask what type of drink I wanted and just gave me anything. Repeated my order 4 times because she couldnt get it right. Had she stopped asking me if I was finished she probably would have gotten it right. Forget about sauce for the nuggets  or napkins. I dont know who in their right mind thought she was capable of giving even the slight bit of customer service. The 2 orders behind me she gave the same attitude (I only know this because I was still waiting for my order). She needs a refresher course on how to treat customers.",1,Negative
Burger King near to jersey city height .. It‚Äôs in a busy area. They have a driveway but driveway space is a very narrow.Food is good.Customer service is OK. Please east little bit dirty due to heavy population. Restroom need more more clean.Good for walking people. There is no free parking before 6 PM. Burgers are really good tasty.,4,Neutral
I like it. The staff is fast and friendly. And did I mention that they give equal opportunity to even workers with disabilities. My favorite employee is this young man who just gives me such a big smile whenever I see him. I have a disabled nephew who's very independent. This young man reminds me of him. He just warms my heart when I see him.  And he's always helping and smiling. Even if the food sucked ( which it doesn't) I would still order from here because I support their hiring. Other companies should follow suit. ‚ù§,5,Positive
"This Burger King is by far one of the worst branches I‚Äôve been to. Over fried and dried mozzarella sticks and their cookies were stale and rock hard. I ordered a coffee and it was flat cold not even warm. Then when I told them my issue, it was reheated in the same styrofoam cup and handed back to me. Bad management. All the staff knows to do is stand behind the counter and make talk and not pay attention to customers trying to talk to them.",1,Negative
11/15 at about 7PM.  3 out of 3 workers seen through the drive through not wearing masks & visibly touching her nose while handling and packing orders. NOT Covid Safe. Never pulled up their masks or anything.,1,Negative
"On occasion they will get my order wrong, the breakfast menu will switch over a little faster than the scheduled time, and the staff will always be stressed out have an attitude. But aside from that, I don't really have a problem.",4,Neutral
This is the first Burger King I've ever been to. It was raining outside and I needed to kill time. There's an air of sad desperation about this place. Homeless people seem to live here all the time. It has all the comfort and atmosphere of an old bus terminal. The food lives in a halo of cheap fat and sadness. This is not a place you would want to hang around. The frys were ok.,2,Negative
"The worst customer service , especially the drive thru is the worst. Went a couple times in the morning at 8am, they responded after waiting for 15 mins.",1,Negative
Food is fine. But good luck with the delivery service from here. Twice now i order delivery and there's missing items when they arrive. And getting a refund is close to impossible. I'm done with this Burger King.,1,Negative
"This is the worst Burger King I have ever seen. It's filthy and I have noticed poor hygiene behavior among employees.  They were smoking at the entrance and when it got busy, one young woman came in and went straight to the food station..I did not see her wash her hands first.

Also the food in my three visits has never been right...cold...overcooked (my friend couldn't even eat her veggie burger as it was microwaved to toughness)..onion rings fried too long so the onion boiled away.. and I felt a little stomach ache a couple hours after eating. This is a never return place for me!",2,Negative
Typical Burger King with all the normal menu items.  Been there 3 times and it is a little sketchy as I see the same 2-3 individuals making themselves at home in the dining area.  Not conducive  if you want to dine in.,3,Negative
Terrible...cold food bad service.... so I decided to give them another try and I'm sorry I did they let me down again let's start off with the homeless money begging people that have made themselves at home that are hanging out in the front charging their phones and watching football games on the Burger King TV..... I waited about 20 minutes just for some nuggets they were definitely understaffed overwhelmed they really need to get it together I will definitely not be going back to their honestly they should just close down,1,Negative
They are really dirty and have a nasty attitude.  I found a hair on the french fries and asked to get me a new one. she did not have a right attitude to replace it and tried to put it back to fries basket to sell it again.. so I had to tell her to trash it. Unbelievable....,1,Negative
"This place is dirty, french fry not really full, didn't feel comfortable to dine in.",1,Negative
Staff needs to be more organized...i was served very cold burger ...and fried ..chicken nuggets were like from day before ...place is kinda dirty ... Wont give any healthy or hygienic feeling.... Its a franchise... they shuld be well aware of the place's situation....after√†ll its busy restaurant..,2,Negative
"Worst BK ever i live  couple blocks away  so I go there a lot ,every time that food taste different,
three times I order a regular cheeseburger and I find bacon inside a sandwich which  is not supposed to have bacon in it !!
The staff is super rude and slow they take for ever to serve you and then even if its not even busy and u the only one there  they still take forever to make ur oder ready
I go there at 6:30 and most of what i order the girl say we don‚Äôt have it for today !!!!!! So had to change all my order to end up with somthing totally different from what i went in for !!
Plus It say‚Äôs they open till midnight but if u go there at 10:30  the door is already closed!!!!!!
Worst BK U CAN GO TO IS THIS SPOT AVOID IT ITS ACTUALLY BETTER FOR YOU .",1,Negative
"Incredibly crappy and massively disappointing burger king ever. If this were the last place on earth to get food from, you should think twice. Uncourteos staff, barely cooked food welcomes you at this restaurant. I love how consistently disappointing they are. You don't have to wonder.",1,Negative
"Not bad, good and fast service. But too many flies. The impossible burger would be great with a vegan cheese option. Come on BK, eating it plain sucks.",3,Negative
This particular location is the worst Burger King I‚Äôve ever been to. Don‚Äôt bother ordering from here whether it‚Äôs a pick up or delivery. It‚Äôs horrible either way.,1,Negative
Sub par service. The cashier was not good at answering simple questions about menu items and messed up my order. I wanted a bacon cheese burger and did not receive one.,3,Negative
I see why they have bad reviews worst Burger King they never try to give you the receipt because they know their going get bad ratings also they  never do your order right make sure you watch them and check your food smfh never going back hard fries messed up burger order they always don‚Äôt have something in stock what type of garbage establishment is this fire everyone their,1,Negative

Don't even acknowledge costumers,  waited ten minutes with only a person in front of me.  Chit chat is more important than the costumers",1,Negative
they forget my chicken sandwich they gave me half of large onions rings which was to hard to eat and they game me cheese burgers instead of double cheeseburgers. worst burger king ever . This happen on Sunday November 22 2020 at 8pm .,1,Negative
I make family order you forgot the soda and the fries this a second time and the most horrible in the storie we find a hair in one sandwich,1,Negative
Delivery order was incomplete. Did receive burnt nuggets and hard mozzarella sticks. Numerous phone calls went unanswered.,1,Negative
It's a great place but more space is needed in the Drive-Thru. It's very tight back there and you have to be very very careful. Besides that it's a very clean and good place to have a meal.,5,Positive
It's a basic burgerkinf no frills  places not clean.,3,Negative

Hmmm, I was getting an angry whopper for my 5 yr old grandson, the young lady though very nice, failed to let me know there were deals associated with this purchase so I question the service in this specific case; otherwise, if you know the menu and the deals, you are good to go. The drive thru is always a ridiculous wait and the management doesn't seem to mind. Go figure.",4,Negative

I love Burger King but I must say this is my least favorite. I will go on occasions because I live nearby. The staff has no manners. The place had a bad smell. They needed to put the AC on for a while. I felt like think they are doing me a favor. I will try Popeyes chicken next time.,2,Negative

"I just stopped by on my way home.  In comparison to other burger kings, this one was just Ok!  They didn't have onion rings sauce but offered tarter sauce as a replacement? The ingredients weren't the best, the tomatoes were not quite ripe and the lettuce was sparse. It's Ok.",3,Neutral

"This store is absolutely disgusting. It always filthy no matter the time of day. I reluctantly ordered online because my son loves Popeyes and we needed a quick meal. When I arrived to pick up the order the cashier told me someone had taken my order already. That‚Äôs it, I had to leave or order again and dispute the charge with Popeyes corporate.",1,Negative
"After traveling far and wide and spending tons of money on fried chicken. I can safely recommend that Popeyes has the best fried chicken and chicken sandwich.
The sandwich is delicious juicy and full of texture. It‚Äôs hands down the best fried chicken",5,Positive
"I wish I could honestly give this place 0 stars. This place has the worst service ever, I was looking at the menu looking to see what to order and the cashier was so impatient and had the worst attitude. While I was waiting in line for my order, one of the other customers came up to the cashier and had said that she ordered fries. The same cashier showing me attitude was giving attitude to the other customer saying how she never heard her ask for fries. When I got my order I asked for two sprites, the same cashier who did my order gave me one sprite and another coca cola, I just let it go but when me and my cousin to a sip from our drinks it tasted like it contained lemonade (as if someone put lemonade in the cups first and then just poured it out). Not only that but I FOUND A HAIR IN MY CHICKEN. They didn't even include the biscuit in my combo. The place is absolutely disgusting, the floors were sticking, and there was multiple filled garbage bags in the corner of the restaurant. Also when I asked for sauce in Burger King (which is connected to Popeyes) I had to pay 25 cents! 25 cents!!!! Over just buffalo sauce!!!! I could get that any where else for free!!!! Worst. Fast. Food. Restaurant. I've. Ever. Been. To!!!! Never coming back here again, and i hope you won't either.",1,Negative
The cashier has a really bad attitude. When I asked her name she said ( Joury) I don‚Äôt if it‚Äôs right or wrong.,1,Negative
It was burger king on 5th ave and 86 street.  I was served a cold whopper not even warm.  The american cheese was still cold and not even melted.  I was very dissappointed.  I will never recommend this burger king to anyone.  üòê ‚Ä¶,1,Negative

All my family members got sick and vomited after we ate from this place. I took my son except for emergency. My wife and I vomited at home. It's unbelievable.,1,Negative
"Saturday December 3rd, they missed chicken sandwich in my order and the chicken we got was raw.",1,Negative
The worst place ever have been.  I order spicy chicken sandwich which is very salty and waste of money .  Butterfly Shrimp is rated less.  Pls don‚Äôt waste your money in this location.  It‚Äôs in negative point not even zero. WASTE OF MONEY,1,Negative
"I ordered on the app, order #2...im a very patient person but when I saw they were already helping order #21 I had to say something on top of which I saw half my order just sitting there. Also thanks for using gloves but also touching absolutely everything else with the same gloves, picking up their pants, things they were throwing out...not cool I am grateful I only ordered things they didn't need to actually touch not even the liner paper for the box. Sucks NC I love the food! Maybe I'll try again on a different day and time.",2,Negative
Food‚Äôs delicious but the quantity is definitely lacking as compared to other Popeyes locations. Their mash is hardly even half full.,2,Negative
"Hands down one of the lousiest location known to mankind. This location shares a spot with BK (I believe). I came here to get some dinner and the experience was enough to make me never want to come back here again. The lines were incredibly long and even though indoor dining was allowed when I went, they had no where to sit or even wait for my order.

At this location something is always down or not working. When I went, their credit card machine was down and they ran out of fries. After waiting on line for 40 minutes and waiting for another 30 minutes for food, it made me question their definition of ""fast food"". The cashiers were incredibly rude and aggressive. I asked for sauce for my shrimp and tenders and was told it was 25 cents  even though I didn't get any. The customer before me got extra sauces for free and kindly offered me one since I didn't want to break a $20 bill for one sauce. I passed on their offer but, it was nice of them. It's just annoying that they are stuck on some of their policies for some people but, not everyone.",1,Negative
"It seems like Popeye's quality has gone down here, since the chicken tenders essentially were deep battered gristle.",1,Negative
"M, 29

Received the wrong order. Was told to return to store next day since store was closing. Returned to the store and was told since I ordered via app (even though it was pickup through their own application) that I have to request a refund and my order can't be replaced. I didn't have enough money to place a new order so I have to wait until my order is refunded fully now (that policy blows my mind) . Overall poor service. Not only did I not get my items, but they weren't even replaced.",1,Negative
"If I could give 0 stars I would. I never write reviews, but the customer service and professionalism from both the website specialist and this location's employees is truly lacking. I ordered from the Popeye's website, I get an email saying that the order was cancelled, but another one after saying that it got processed. So, me thinking that it was an error, I call THIS LOCATION (since it's the one that was assigned to my order) and I give them my name and order number, they tell me that the order was processed and it was being done. 30 minutes pass, I call again and give them the information AGAIN and they tell me that they were waiting for a driver to pick up the order. Another 40 minutes pass, I CALL AGAIN. They tell me my order was cancelled........... After 1 HOUR AND 40 MINUTES and $50 taken from me. There needs to be a way where both employees and the website can communicate appropriately so there aren't employees lying to customers saying that their order is ""on its way"" when in reality it wasn't. 3 different employees, 2 lied and said the order was on its way, the last one said it was cancelled and proceeded to HANG UP THE PHONE instead of working the situation out. Truly a waste of my time, I wouldn't recommend ever ordering from the website if assigned to this location EVER.",1,Negative
"Terrible, the damnn woman ignored me and went about taking care of everyone else, totally ignored me!!",1,Negative
place is not staffed adequately as there is only ever one person making or taking orders. it‚Äôs completely ridiculous you could consider this to be fast food,1,Negative
"1 star is generous. It's a miracle this place is still open. The service is terrible, the restaurant is consistently dirty, and it takes 20 minutes to get a chicken sandwich. They actually tell you this when you order, perhaps to dissuade you. C'mon do better.",1,Negative
For a sandwich i waited 22 minutes popeyes supposed to be fast food if you don‚Äôt have ready things for sandvic just say it will be late 22 minutes makes 13$ woth my hourly salary I spent 13$ for sandvic so total bs better manager needed,1,Negative
"Here‚Äôs my list of issues
1. I ordered my meal online and they didn‚Äôt even know about it
2. I had to wait for my meal way  passed the time I scheduled to pick it up. I asked for it at a certain time because I needed it at that time.
3. The person at the counter couldn‚Äôt communicate with me well enough to tell me what was going on instead just tells me to wait

Rude and inefficient staff. They took the efficiency and ease out of ordering ahead. What‚Äôs the point of ordering ahead if I have to wait 25 minutes to get me food after the pick up time? This isnt the only time this has happened so be mindful of the issues before you order there

Update: The chicken is really good though",1,Negative
"Every time I order online or walk in store to this location, it‚Äôs a problem. They consistently get my order wrong. They‚Äôre not friendly. Even when you do mobile order, no one is calling out numbers or names. The pieces are usually overcooked and the biscuits are old. For all the special offers and free delivery, it isn‚Äôt worth it! Not if you‚Äôre looking for a good chicken dinner. I‚Äôve never had any issues at Popeyes restaurants before, but this location is the worst. If anything, try a neighboring location. It‚Äôs not clean in there either, and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a Burger King issue or not. Either way, there are plenty nearby restaurants, including a KFC not too far away, if you want to get your money‚Äôs worth. Never again!",1,Negative
The most terrible place. I'm waiting every time!!!,1,Negative
"This is the most disgusting location ever I see!! Very careless and rude employees . I order 4 pieces & the employees who work there gave me only 3 pieces. Another day I order 4 spicy chicken & the employees gave me not spicy & very dried , when I talk to them , they said this is what available!! We don‚Äôt have spicy!!
They always do bad things to stop people coming to this store.. the employees are very disrespectful",1,Negative
"Best chicken burger ever. My first time in Popeyes. Always thought they only have fry chicken until I accidentally walked in. I actually wanted to go burger king and realized popeyes was next to it and they were connected to each other. Then I decided to take a look and gave it a try.
Burger is bigger, and quality is much better than other fast food chain store. Chicken is crispy and bread is not soggy like in the other store. Many options of sides I get to choose from. Counter service is friendly. The place is clean. And lights are dimmer, I like the environment.
Overall it was a great experience. Will definitely  go again next week.",5,Positive
"This the location on 5th Ave in Bay Ridge Brooklyn, btw 86/85th streets. The time was around 8:10pm and there was a 10 minute wait for a cinnamon pie, which I declined to wait for. The chicken sandwich was ready, but there were no napkins in the bag or anywhere near the tables or condiment sections. I was not asked if I wanted any sauce for the sandwich, hence my rating. Needs improvement.",3,Negative
The chicken was very good but the bread was soggy. I like soggy bread as much as I like soggy socks.,3,Negative
"I went to this Popeyes tonight after placing an online order for a regular chicken sandwich. After talking to the server and informing her that I‚Äôm waiting for mobile order 02, she walked away and ignored me for about 10 minutes. I spoke to her again and all of a sudden she tells me that they don‚Äôt accept mobile orders, and said that she will bring the managed out to talk to me. After waiting another 10 minutes the manager comes out and tells me to contact my bank and ask them to cancel the transaction because they don‚Äôt accept mobile orders. And after waiting 20 in the store the manager rudely informs me that if I want to order a chicken sandwich I will have to stand in like and re do the whole process. I left the store and contacted my bank only for the bank to tell me that they only way to cancel the transaction at this point is for the store to do it. Or I would have to wait for the transaction to post to my credit card then I would dispute it then the bank will launch an investigation. I will never be eating here again, and if I can give the store zero stars I will. Worst management system ever and the workers are extremely disrespectful to customers.

Update !! It‚Äôs been 3 weeks and my bank is unable refund me the money, and now I have to go through a whole dispute process because of their trashy customer service.",1,Negative
"I ordered a spicy tenders meal and waited over 20 minutes for it. They said it would take full cooking time and I said that was fine(at least I knew I'd get fresh food that way.) I see tenders come up and go out and the manager comes out and tells me its going to be the full cooking time again and walks away,no apology or anything. After seeing people who ordered before me and after me getting their food but I'm the only one told I have to wait again, is ridiculous among other words I'd like to use but won't.",1,Negative
"Put a Mobile order at 7:20pm. Gave a little time before I headed out. Arrived asked if order 85 was being worked on, got confirmation. They started working on my order at 8:00pm. Ended up getting my order at 8:15. Waited almost a full hour for 1 order!",1,Negative
"Ordered all dark meats, and he gave me these",1,Negative
"I was trying to place an order for this place, and the cashier was ignoring me and pretending I was not there. I wasted 15 mins out of my 30 mins break and didn't even eat from here. Never going to this popeyes again!",1,Negative
"The Pakistani workers are really respectful and they serve you warmly but some African American work there talking badly especially the young ones
I wish that management of the store reconsider hiring some of the people they currently work for. Thank you",1,Negative
The place is decent they share space with the Burger King next door. The staff is okay. There food is not fresh but edible and the chicken tend to be dry. I prefer the only on 7th ave and 61st . The tables are not really clean. The soda machines run out of soda quick and options become limited.Sometimes the lines are really long and the wait turns to 15 min wait for a fast food place. They are stingy w/ asking for extra sauce and will charge you extra for it.,3,Negative
"This Popeyes is absolutely disgraceful, I would give it no starts but that is not an option. The staff is incompetent, especially the manager. The food is either overcooked and hard, or undercooked and soggy. A simple order could not get completed properly. The phone number is off the hook, and the customer service is terrible. When they mess up your order, they have an attitude as if it was your fault. Don't waste your time cause service is slow, don't waste your money, atleast not at this location.",1,Negative
"Absolutely horrible. This was my first time in Popeyes to buy a family meal. The man was not helpful at all, could not answer a single question, and started SCREAMING at me! Also, I was just asking what kind of chicken came with the meal.
The chicken looked great, but I have no idea how it is. Screaming ""OK thank you bye,"" is not an appropriate answer to ""what kind of chicken comes with the meal?""

Just go somewhere else.",1,Negative
"Definitely reliable chicken combos available here. There's not much to complain about except for the occasional customers who frequent the restaurant. Outside of that, they do offer a good product.  Their counterpart that they co-locate with (Burger King) has serious issues on all fronts. Ample seating at most hours. If tables are full during peak hours, the second floor is a good option, as there is more seating and another bathroom.",5,Positive
"Costumers need to chill... while I was there, a customer gave all the employees attitude. It's a long wait but the costumers are the ones that made me the most uncomfortable. The chicken sandwich was worth it. I wish the employees the best of luck!",3,Positive
"The food is okay, and normally I have a high tolerance for bad service, but this place can get really bad. They never NEVER answer the phone. I don't even know why they bother listing a phone number. The food can be slow, and you should check your bag before you leave.",3,Negative
This Popeye location is unsanitary. The worker who prepared my food has poor hygiene. He touched cash money then prepared my food without any gloves or washing his hands. I would like to see the workers take more precautions since covid is still present.,1,Negative
"This Popeyes is terrible; the employees are rude and even if you place a mobile order you still have to wait in line and place the order again. Completely defeating the purpose of mobile ordering. Avoid this one completely, you‚Äôll save more time driving or even walking to the other Popeyes in Bay Parkway.",1,Negative
"been here in Bay Ridge for a long time with positive greeting and nice staffs providing orders in time and with warm chicken and other type of foods, they have deals they are great for groups. Sometimes they need to clean the table because some customers don't know how to clean themselves up",4,Positive
Food is good...bad service....25 min waiting x my order.......and they gave me my order incomplete........make sure to check your food's  contents before you leave............should have responsible employees.....they need to do their job and,2,Negative
This location is horrid. Can‚Äôt get an order correct to save their lives. Most chicken sandwiches are inedible due to woody breast. The workers here simply don‚Äôt care.,1,Negative
Over cook. Dead meats. Hard to bite. All the problems from the pics.,1,Negative
"I placed an order for a mobile pick up and waited 30 minutes for my dinner. Once my number was called they told me that they don't accept mobile orders any longer but it the option was available on the website.

Not only did I get charged, I wasted my time waiting for it that I will never get back. Instead of popeyes refunding my money they told me I have to call my credit card company and cancel the order. Why do I have to use more of my time to get my money back for something that I never received as well as waste my time? Instead, why doesn't the store manager contact popeyes corporate to remove the service?",1,Negative
"I had that new chicken sandwich and it was very enjoyable.  But if you dont like mayo, you must ask for the plain one. The spicy is a mayo based sauce. Soo for me mayo stopped any chance of me eating the spicy chicken. But the plain was actually just fine with no sauce or any sort of condiment..",4,Positive
"Where to start?!? When fast-food isn't? I know this place though not well. Came in today and they'd moved their amazing Coke-cola freestyle soda fountain behind the counter - clearly customers were abusing it. Took a wee while to get my order and the woman in front of me was complaining about how long the wait was. Then she went up and proceeded to take forever and complained that her kids don't eat legs so no legs only big pieces (welcome to New York City folks!). I placed my order for 2 spicy pieces and two biscuits and lemonade. Which lemonade I was asked? The one that's boldly advertised on the machine right in front of you, to stay please. I got my order but had to remind her it was spicy and even though I said to stay they bagged it. Then I was told that I the lemonade I wanted was more money and I said I told her I wanted this one and I tapped on the glass of the fountain machine. Ok I get my food, no issue. We not done though. A woman in the store w 3 kids and I guess her husband who bailed early, not really supervising her kids on completely barefooted one hoping over the back of the seat to get out and the cutest little one just meandering around the store. Little cute one sits on the seat and this pisses and it just streams all over and onto the floor. Mom exclaim something in Arabic and cleans up quick like and tells someone that there's a mess. Guy comes to clean and doesn't a whack job until I tell him what really happened. Overall, the big challenge here is the people, prob mostly the customers and they haven't figured out how to manage that. It gets a 2 because that chicken and biscuit and the lemonade was pretty slamming!",2,Negative
"After 17 days at home cooking, I was dreaming about some fr√≠es from Popeyes so I ordered a combo meal, and guess what! Everything came except the fries. I was really mad because no one answered the phone in the store and Door Dash didn‚Äôt know what happened.",1,Negative
I waited 25 minutes for a chicken sandwich and 5 boneless chicken wings. I was order number 33 and was served after number 49!!! The manager wasnt even apologetic. Could have thrown in a few extra chicken wings for my trouble!,1,Negative
"Food was as expected, actually very hot so very fresh. Only thing bringing it down is I asked for just one small cup of water and was told they dont have any when the drink machine has a water button. Trying to get a sale vs a simple drink seems pretty pretty....",3,Neutral
"The night crew is VERY DISRESPECTFUL.  The 2 clowns that are at the front counter are VERY unprofessional . First of all when you are working you are not supposed to speak other languages unless you are speaking with a costumer.  I believe they were speaking Arabic.  Then top top things of they mocked me when I said ""no pickle"".
I will NEVER spend my money at this popeye.
Those 2 clowns need to get FIRED.",1,Negative
"Today I ordered some food from popeyes for my 10years old son.the chicken tender wasn‚Äôt cooked properly, coleslaw had some kind of foul smell.
The fries and the biscuits was good.",1,Negative
"Presentation & preparation of the food is nice but, they sold me spoiled & burned Cajun rice. It smelled awful as well. Please check your food before leaving the store. In my case I had no choice because I‚Äôve ordered take out from uber eats.",1,Negative
"Terrible experience, just like all the other one-star reviews. I should‚Äôve read these before ordering. Overcooked and recooked chicken tenders, missing an item from my delivery and the chicken made me sick.",1,Negative
This is my neighborhood Popeye's we've eaten there so many time but  last Sat 7/3/20 after ordering my food and there were no signs they said I couldn't use my debt Card to pay. I wonder whyü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î They lost a customer and I went to Mc Donald's. Where is the sign??? Where was the manger???? ‚Ä¶,1,Negative
Purchased a $5 deal boneless wings box and was very delighted to receive ten chicken morsels with the side of fries and biscuit.  This was not what I'd expected.  Further they were chunks of chicken. A deal well worth the $5.,4,Positive
"Can't go wrong with some Popeyes. I bought my kids the kids meal. They loved it, but it doesn't come with a biscuit. Next time I'll buy a couple on the side!",5,Positive
Ordered a large coleslaw and it turned out it was spoiled.   Asked for a refund and the people there were not too helpful.  They even asked me to wait for 10 mins in order to give me a refund without an apology.,1,Negative
I ordered a chicken sandwich on the Popeyes App only for the restaurant to tell me that they don't accept mobile orders. They then refused to refund me and asked me to call my bank to dispute the charge if I want a refund. Very shady business practices (especially since they choose to allow mobile ordering) and poor costumer service. I would avoid.,1,Negative
They have specials and don't suggest them to there customers. Show appreciation for the customers. Paid more more less. Other establishments would suggest the deal in order to make customer happier and save them money..,2,Negative
WORST STAFF EVER! I would give a Negative rating if I can. Staff was rude and the store isn‚Äôt clean at all. Staff was giving attitude to customer. Honestly go home if you don‚Äôt want to work. AVOID this place !!!!!!!!!!,1,Negative
"The chicken was not fresh it seems it was on shelves for long time I could tell coz i used to work in a fried chicken place, and the worst the drinks machine was broken all the drinks was tasteless and more watery than anything. The worst Popeyes I have ever been.",1,Negative
The cashier got the order of the person 4 people infront of me and it ground their entire operation to a halt during the dinner time rush.   This place is poorly run and the workers make up the rules on how they service their customers wildly.,1,Negative
"Today 8/3/2020  at 7:30 I went to pick up an order and i saw and employee coming to the front to talk another guy I guess his manager, he had gloves on and I saw him touching his nose and fixing his hat, then he went back to do the orders and didn‚Äôt even change his gloves,",1,Negative
"The food is consistent, and the new chicken sandwich is great (until it sold out). But the staff are always overwhelmed and a touch confused. Be patient.",3,Neutral
Fried chicken. Very healthy for you. Eat as much was possible üòã. Very clean run and employees are nice. Fried apple pies are also very healthy. Chickens are apparently turkey-sized now too. ‚Ä¶,3,Positive
"The food is stale, and you can‚Äôt even choose the parts of the chicken you want. And what‚Äôs even worse, the supervisors deliver poor customer service.",1,Negative
"They refused to serve me because I didnt have my vaccination card, not to dine in but refuse to serve me at all. Just horrible",1,Negative
Wrong order and also the takeout bag‚Ä¶,1,Negative
"Ordered 3 chicken sandwich for the family, but only received two, tried to call them, online support is unavailable, and no one picks up the phone, One of the sandwich was made with two pieces of the bottom bread, nasty service.",1,Negative
"Cold, over cooked, shrimps were tiny all batter and still had the tail on. Do not buy the shrimps. Overload on cold fries as well.",1,Negative
We had to wait for our order and people who came after us got their food before us.  When it was suggested that the staff should tell us we have to wait longer than 20 min for our food we were ignored and the young woman cut her eyes at us.  Have no plans to return to this establishment again,2,Negative
This is the other half of Burger King. Popeye's offers some great deals on chicken. You can get a whole box for about $10. The edge they have over KFC is that you get honey and hot sauce here. This location is a little stingy and you have to ask for all the packets.,3,Neutral
"New staff and management are slow, disrespectful and will mess up your order after you finally get it! Avoid!!!",1,Negative

Good fresh chicken all the time,4,Positive
"I like to eat popeyes but when I ordered rice and bean with bacon I was asked 3 times if I was a Moslem, which I felt very unhappy about.  The place is 100% Pakistanis, what happened to equal opportunity?",2,Negative
Bathroom was out of service with no changing table. Employee in charge of cleaning tables was impolite refusing to give us a cup for serving some water for our kids. Hopefully I'm not coming back to that place.,2,Negative
Zero star,1,Negative
